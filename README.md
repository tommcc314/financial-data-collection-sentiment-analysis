# Financial Data Collection and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and files generated as part of a project done by UConn students, faculty and Wilton High School students. 

The objective of the project is to explore the relationship between business outlook reports and stock performance. We quantified these reports using Python sentiment analysis libraries.
