# Financial Data Collection and Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and files generated as part of a project done by UConn students, faculty and Wilton High School students. 

The objective of the project is to explore the relationship between business outlook reports and stock performance. To start, we used SEC 10K reports: sections 1A and 7, which include Risk Factors and Managementâ€™s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Other possible sources of data are financial news from sites such as Yahoo Finance and conference calls.

We quantified these sentiment of these reports using Python sentiment analysis libraries and used NumPy and MatPlotLib to analyze the relationship.
