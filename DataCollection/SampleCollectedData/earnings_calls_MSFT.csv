We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much, Brett. The Microsoft Cloud delivered over $28 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22% and 25% in constant currency, demonstrating our continued leadership across the tech stack. We continue to focus on three priorities: First, helping customers use the breadth and depth of the Microsoft Cloud to get the most value out of their digital spend. Second, investing to lead in the new AI wave across our solution areas, and expanding our TAM. And, third, driving operating leverage, aligning our cost structure with our revenue growth. Now, I’ll highlight examples of our progress, starting with infrastructure. Azure took share, as customers continue to choose our ubiquitous computing fabric – from cloud to edge, especially as every application becomes AI-powered. We have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it’s being used by our partner OpenAI, as well as NVIDIA, and leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection to train large models. Our Azure OpenAI Service brings together advanced models, including ChatGPT and GPT-4, with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. From Coursera and Grammarly, to Mercedes-Benz and Shell, we now have more than 2,500 Azure OpenAI Service customers, up 10X quarter-over-quarter. Just last week, Epic Systems shared that it was using Azure OpenAI Service to integrate the next generation of AI with its industry-leading EHR software. Azure also powers OpenAI API. And we’re pleased to see brands like Shopify and Snap use the API to integrate OpenAI’s models. More broadly, we continue to see the world’s largest enterprises migrate key workloads to our cloud. Unilever, for example, went all-in on Azure this quarter, in one of the largest-ever cloud migrations in the consumer goods industry. IKEA Retail, ING Bank, Rabobank, Telstra, and Wolverine Worldwide all use Azure Arc to run Azure services across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 15,000 Azure Arc customers, up over 150% year-over-year. And we’re extending our infrastructure to 5G network edge with Azure for Operators. We are the cloud of choice for telcos, and at MWC last month, AT&T, Deutsche Telekom, Singtel, and Telefonica all shared how they are using our infrastructure to modernize and monetize their networks. Now, on to data. Our Intelligent Data Platform brings together databases, analytics, and governance, so organizations can spend more time creating value and less time integrating their data estate. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world’s most demanding workloads at any scale. OpenAI relies on Cosmos DB to dynamically scale their ChatGPT service – one of the fastest-growing consumer apps ever – enabling high reliability and low maintenance. The NBA uses Cosmos DB to ingest more than 10 million data points per game, helping teams optimize their gameplay. And, we are taking share with our analytics solutions. Companies like BP, Canadian Tire, Marks & Spencer, and T-Mobile all rely on our end-to-end analytics to improve speed-to-insight. Now, on to developers. From Visual Studio to GitHub, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud – all while staying in their flow. Today, 76% of the Fortune 500 use GitHub to build, ship, and maintain software. And with GitHub Copilot, the first at-scale AI developer tool, we’re fundamentally transforming the productivity of every developer, from novices to experts. In three months since we made Copilot for Business broadly available, over 10,000 organizations have signed up, including the likes of Coca-Cola and GM, as well as Duolingo and Mercado Libre, all of which credit Copilot with increasing the speed for their developers. We’re also bringing next generation AI to Power Platform, so anyone can automate workflows, create apps or web pages, build virtual agents, and analyze data using only natural language. More than 36,000 organizations have already used existing AI-powered capabilities in Power Platform. And with our new Copilot in Power Apps, we’re extending these capabilities to end users who can interact with any app through conversation instead of clicks. All-up, we now have nearly 33 million monthly active users of Power Platform, up nearly 50% year-over-year. Now, on to business applications. From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve, as organizations like Asahi, C.H. Robinson, E.ON, Franklin Templeton choose our AI-powered business applications to automate, simulate, and predict every business process and function. And we’re going further, with Dynamics 365 Copilot, which works across CRM and ERP systems to bring the next generation of AI to employees in every job function, reducing burdensome tasks like manual data entry, content generation, and notetaking. Now, on to our industry and cross-industry solutions. Our Cloud for Sustainability is seeing strong adoption from companies in every industry, including BBC, Nissan, and PCL, as they deliver on their respective environmental commitments. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last week, as we expanded our offerings for payors and added new AI-powered capabilities for providers. We showcased the first fully AI-automated clinical documentation application, Nuance DAX Express, which will bring GPT-4 to more than 550,000 existing users of Dragon Medical. And, at Hannover-Messe manufacturing trade show, Siemens shared how it will use a Teams app integrated with Azure OpenAI Service to optimize factory workflows. Now, on to future of work. Microsoft 365 Copilot combines next generation AI with business data in the Microsoft Graph and Microsoft 365 applications, removing the drudgery and unleashing the creativity of work. Copilot works alongside users, embedded in the Microsoft 365 applications millions use every day, and it also powers Business Chat, which uses natural language to surface information and insights based on business content and context. We’ve been encouraged by early feedback, and look forward to bringing these experiences to more users in the coming months. Teams usage is at an all-time high and surpassed 300 million monthly active users this quarter. And we once again took share across every category — from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling — as we add value for existing customers and win new ones like ABN AMRO, Jaguar Land Rover, Mattress Firm, Unisys, and Vodafone. We announced a new version of Teams that delivers up to two times faster performance, while using 50% less memory, so customers can collaborate more efficiently and prepare for experiences like Copilot. Teams is also expanding our TAM. Nearly 60% of our enterprise Teams customers buy Teams Phone, Rooms, or Premium. Teams Phone is the undisputed market leader in cloud calling, helping our customers reduce costs with a three-year ROI of over 140%. Teams Rooms revenue more than doubled year-over-year. And Teams Premium meets enterprise demand for AI-powered features like intelligent recaps. Now generally available, it’s one of our fastest growing Modern Work products ever, with thousands of paid customers just two months in. With Microsoft Viva, we’ve created a completely new suite for employee experience. Viva brings together goals, communications, learning, workplace analytics, and employee feedback. Across industries, companies like Dell, Mastercard, and SES are using Viva to help their employees thrive. Just last week, we announced Copilot for Viva, offering leaders a new way to build high-performance teams by prioritizing both productivity and employee engagement. And with Viva Sales, we’ve extended the platform to specific job functions, helping sellers apply large language models to their CRM and Microsoft 365 data, so they can automatically generate content, like customer mails. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Ferrovial, Goldman Sachs, Novo Nordisk, and Rogers all chose E5 to empower their employees with our best-in-class productivity apps, along with advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. While the PC market continues to face headwinds, we again saw record monthly active Windows devices, and higher usage, compared to pre-pandemic. We are also seeing accelerated growth in Windows 11 commercial deployments. Over 90% of the Fortune 500 are currently trialing or have deployed Windows 11. And with Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop, we continue to transform how employees at companies like Mazda and Nationwide access Windows. All-up, over one-third of our enterprise customer base has purchased cloud-delivered Windows to date. And new Windows 365 Frontline extends the power and security of Cloud PCs to shift workers for the first time. Now, on to security. Our comprehensive, AI-powered solutions spanning all clouds and all platforms give the agility advantage back to defenders. Among analysts, we are the leader in more categories than any other provider, and we once again took share across all major categories we serve. And we continue to introduce new products and functionality to further protect customers. With Security Copilot, we’re combining large language models with a domain-specific model informed by our threat intelligence and 65 trillion daily security signals, to transform every aspect of the SOC productivity. We also added new governance controls and policy protections to better secure identities, along with resources they access. Nearly 720,000 organizations now use Azure Active Directory, up 33% year-over-year. And, all-up, nearly 600,000 customers now have four or more security workloads, up 35% year-over-year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. EY and Qualcomm, for example, both chose our full security stack to ensure the highest levels of protection and visibility across their organizations. Now, on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement, as more than 930 million members turn to the professional social network to connect, learn, sell, and get hired. Member growth accelerated for the seventh consecutive quarter, as we expanded to new audiences. We now have 100 million members in India, up 19%. And as Gen Z enters the workforce, we saw a 73% year-over-year increase in the number of student sign ups. In this persistently tight labor market, LinkedIn Talent Solutions continues to help hirers connect to job seekers and professionals to build the skills they need to access opportunity. Our hiring business took share for the third consecutive quarter. The excitement around AI is creating new opportunities across every function, from marketing, sales, and finance, to software development and security. LinkedIn is increasingly where people are going to learn, discuss, and uplevel their skills, with more than 100 AI courses. And we’ve introduced new AI-powered features, including writing suggestions for member profiles and job descriptions, and collaborative articles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe, trusted platform. More broadly, we continue to expand our opportunity in advertising. Our exclusive partnership with Netflix brings differentiated, premium video content to our ad network. And, our new Copilot for the web is reshaping daily search and web habits. Two months since the launch of new Bing and Edge, we’re very encouraged by user feedback and usage patterns. All-up, Bing has more than 100 million daily active users. We are winning new customers on Windows and mobile. Daily installs of the Bing mobile app have grown 4X since launch. We’re making progress in share gains. Edge took share for the eighth consecutive quarter, and Bing once again grew share in the United States. We continue to innovate with first-of-their-kind AI-powered features, including the ability to set the tone of chat and create images from text prompts, powered by Dall-E. Over 200 million images have been created to date. And, we see that when people use these new AI features, their engagement with Bing and Edge goes up. As we look towards a future where chat becomes a new way for people to seek information, consumers have real choice in business model and modalities with Azure-powered chat entrypoints across Bing, Edge, Windows, and OpenAI’s ChatGPT. We look forward to continuing this journey in what is a generational shift in the largest software category – search. Now, on to gaming. We are rapidly executing on our ambition to be the first choice for people to play great games whenever, however, and wherever they want. We set third quarter records for monthly active users and monthly active devices. Across our content & services business, we are delivering on our commitment to offer gamers more ways to experience the games they love. Our revenue from subscriptions reached nearly $1 billion this quarter. This quarter, we also brought PC Game Pass to 40 new countries, nearly doubling the number of markets we’re available. Great content remains the flywheel behind our growth. We have now surpassed 500 million lifetime unique users across our first party titles. And I’ve never been more excited about our pipeline of games, including the fourth quarter launches of Minecraft Legends and Redfall. In closing, we are focused on continuing to raise the bar on our operational excellence and performance, as we innovate to help our customers maximize the value of their existing technology investments and thrive in the new era of AI. In a few weeks times, we’ll hold our Build conference, and we will share how we are building the most powerful AI platform for developers. And I encourage you to tune in. I could not be more energized about the opportunities ahead. And with that, let me turn it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our third quarter revenue was $52.9 billion, up 7% and 10% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.45 and increased 10% and 14% in constant currency. Our results exceeded expectations, driven by focused execution from our sales teams and partners. In our commercial business, revenue was up 19% in constant currency. We saw better-than-expected renewal strength, including across Microsoft 365 which also benefited Windows Commercial given the higher in-period revenue recognition. In Office 365 standalone products, we saw improvement in new business growth, while growth trends in EMS and Windows Commercial standalone products remained consistent with Q2. In Azure, customers continued to exercise some caution as optimization and new workload trends from the prior quarter continued as expected. In our consumer business, PC demand was a bit better than we expected, particularly in the commercial segment, which benefited Windows OEM and Surface even as channel inventory levels remain elevated which negatively impacted results. Advertising spend landed in line with our expectations. We have seen share gains in Azure, Dynamics, Teams, Security, Edge, and Bing as we continue to focus on delivering high value as well as new innovative solutions to our customers, including next generation AI capabilities. Commercial bookings increased 11% and 12% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable, with a declining expiry base and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. The better-than-expected result was driven by strong execution across our renewal sales motions mentioned earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 26% to $196 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 18% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 34%. And this quarter, our annuity mix was again 96%. FX impact on total company revenue, segment level revenue, and operating expense growth was as expected. FX decreased COGS growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $28.5 billion and grew 22% and 25% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72%, a point ahead of expectations driven by cloud engineering efficiencies. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by lower Azure margin. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Gross margin percentage increased year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue. Operating expense increased 7% and 9% in constant currency, about $300 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by roughly 2 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, as well as investments in cloud engineering and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount at the end of March was 9% higher than a year ago. Operating income increased 10% and 15% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Operating margins increased roughly 1 point year-over-year to 42%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins decreased slightly and increased slightly in constant currency. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17.5 billion and grew 11% and 15% in constant currency, ahead of expectations primarily driven by better-than-expected results in Office commercial. Office commercial revenue grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution mentioned earlier and E5 momentum. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 11% year-over-year to over 382 million, with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was again driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing declined 1% and increased 5% in constant currency, better than expected with 11 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Office consumer revenue increased 1% and 4% in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12% to 65.4 million. LinkedIn revenue increased 8% and 10% in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions. Dynamics revenue grew 17% and 21% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 25% and 29% in constant currency with healthy growth across all workloads. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly driven by improvements in Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expenses increased 4% and 5% in constant currency, and operating income increased 20% and 27% in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $22.1 billion, increasing 16% and 19% in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 27% and 31% in constant currency. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 15% to nearly 250 million seats. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency, with continued demand for our hybrid offerings, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, offset by transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6% and 9% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Operating expenses increased 19% and 20% in constant currency, including roughly 3 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 13% and 17% in constant currency, with roughly 6 points from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, decreasing 9% and 7% in constant currency, with better-than-expected results across all businesses. Windows OEM revenue decreased 28% year-over-year and Devices revenue decreased 30% and 26% in constant currency, both ahead of expectations. We saw better-than-expected PC demand as noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment which has higher revenue per license, although results continue to be negatively impacted by elevated channel inventory levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue increased 14% and 18% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations primarily due to the strong renewal execution with higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 10% and 13% in constant currency, including 2 points from the Xandr acquisition. Results were driven by higher search volume with share gains again this quarter for our Edge browser globally and Bing in the U.S. And in Gaming, revenue declined 4% and 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 30% and 28% in constant currency on a high prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply. Xbox content and services revenue increased 3% and 5% in constant currency driven by better-than-expected monetization in third-party and first-party content, and growth in Xbox Game Pass. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 5% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly year-over-year. Operating expenses declined 5% and 3% in constant currency, even with 3 points of growth from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 12% and 7% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $7.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.6 billion. Cash flow from operations was $24.4 billion, down 4% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections as well as lower supplier payments were more than offset by a tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision and employee payments primarily related to headcount growth and an increase in employee compensation. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, down 11% year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations increased 1% and free cash flow declined 5%. This quarter, other income and expense was $321 million, higher than anticipated driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q4 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. My commentary, for next quarter and FY24, does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points with no impact to COGS or operating expense growth. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and roughly 1 point in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has many of the trends we saw in Q3 continue thru Q4. In our largest quarter of the year, we expect customer demand for our differentiated solutions including our AI platform and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud to drive another quarter of healthy revenue growth. Last year we had our largest commercial bookings quarter ever with a material volume of large, multi-year commitments. On that comparable, we expect growth to be relatively flat. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions with strong renewals and continued commitments to our platform as we focus on meeting customers’ changing contract needs, which include shorter-term, quick time-to-value contracts in this dynamic environment. Our key focus remains on delivering customer value. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q4 cloud gross margin percentage will be relatively flat as improvements in Office 365 will offset the lower Azure margin and the impact of scaling our AI infrastructure to meet growing demand. We expect capital expenditures to have a material sequential increase on a dollar basis driven by investments in Azure AI infrastructure. Reminder there can be normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 10 and 12% in constant currency or $17.9 to $18.2 billion US dollars. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be roughly 16% in constant currency. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digits revenue growth driven by Talent Solutions with continued strong engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 15% and 16% in constant currency or $23.6 to $23.9 billion US dollars. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be 26% to 27% in constant currency, including roughly 1 point from AI services. Growth continues to be driven by our Azure consumption business and we expect the trends from Q3 to continue into Q4 as noted earlier. Our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions, including Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should be relatively unchanged year-over-year as growth in Enterprise Support Services will be offset by a decline in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $13.35 to $13.75 billion US dollars. PC demand should be similar to Q3 and given channel inventory still remains elevated, our revenue will lag overall market growth as it continues to normalize. Therefore, Windows OEM and Devices revenue should both decline in the low to mid-20s. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits. While we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by continued customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions, a reminder that our quarterly revenue growth can have variability primarily from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. Search and news advertising ex-TAC revenue growth should be approximately 10%, roughly 5 points higher than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growth in first-party revenue that’s similar to Q3. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by third-party and first-party content as well as Xbox Game Pass. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 3% and 4% in constant currency or $16.8 to $17 billion US dollars and operating expense to grow approximately 2% in constant currency or $15.1 to $15.2 billion US dollars. Other income and expense should be roughly $300 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be in line with our full year rate of approximately 19%. And finally, as a reminder for Q4 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.3 billion cash tax payment related to the R&D capitalization provision. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to the next fiscal year. With our leadership position as we begin this AI era, we remain focused on strategically managing the company to deliver differentiated customer value as well as long-term financial growth and profitability. As with any significant platform shift, it starts with innovation, and we are excited about the early feedback and demand signal for the AI capabilities we have announced to date. We will continue to invest in our cloud infrastructure, particularly AI-related spend, as we scale with the growing demand driven by customer transformation. And we expect the resulting revenue to grow over time. As always, we remain committed to aligning costs and revenue growth to deliver disciplined profitability. Therefore, while the scaled capex investments will impact COGS growth, we expect FY24 operating expense growth to remain low. As a team, we have continually focused on pivoting our resources aggressively to the future as we execute at a high level in the moment to deliver value to our customers. That balance has enabled the company to successfully lead across a number of platform shifts over a number of decades. Therefore, we are committed to leading the AI platform wave and making the investments to support it. With that, let’s go to Q&A. Brett? BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question, and congratulations on really a fantastic set of results and what we all know to be a still difficult environment out there. I think it really illustrates Microsoft’s advantages, and a lot of these technology innovations that you guys have been talking about. I wanted to ask you a question that I get probably more often than anything else, and one that I, frankly, don’t have a good answer to, and that’s around the OpenAI partnership, and particularly the accounting for that partnership. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of color about whether or not revenue is flowing from OpenAI into Microsoft on the CapEx side of the equation, whether there’s any impact, just to give us a better understanding of how the accounting around that relationship is working. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. In some ways, let me start by saying it’s a great partnership. We’re proud to have worked together for a number of years, leading to some of the announcements that you’ve heard us make more recently. And we’ve talked about the foundation of our partnership remains that when we both are successful, the other benefits. When we grow, it helps them, and when they grow, it helps us. But specifically to your question on how does it show up, it’s easiest in this situation to think about them as a customer of ours, like any other customer who would use the Azure infrastructure and our Azure AI Services in service of supporting their end customers. And so, when they do that, like any other customer who has a commercial relationship with us, we recognize revenue on that behalf. That’s probably the simplest frame, Keith, that I hope is helpful. KEITH WEISS: Yeah, that’s super helpful. I appreciate that. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Congratulations on the quarter and the guidance, and thanks for taking my question. I’d like to drill into Azure, and more specifically, Azure IaaS PaaS consumption. IaaS PaaS consumption is really stepped down recently, and it’s important to understand the macro versus an optimization that will rebound, whether it’s going to rebound quickly or is there a more fundamental issue? In other words, is this simply purely macro, and everyone is stepping back a little bit, and they’re going to hit the pedal as soon as this comes back, or is there something more fundamental that is driving corporate maybe to step back and that that slowdown to sustain even when the IT spending rebound? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. Maybe I’ll make three comments. And it’s also important, I think, to distinguish between what I would say is macro or absolute performance and relative performance, because I think that’s perhaps a good way to think about how we manage our business. First is optimizations do continue. In fact, we are focused on it. We incent our people to help our customers with optimization, because we believe, in the long run, that’s the best way to secure the loyalty and long-term contracts with customers, when they know that they can count on a cloud provider like us to help them continuously optimize their workflow. That’s sort of the fundamental benefit of public cloud, and we’re taking every opportunity to prove that out with customers in real time. The second thing I’d say is we do have new workloads started, because if you think about it, during the pandemic, it was all about new workloads and scaling workloads. But pre-pandemic, there was a balance between optimizations and new workloads. What we’re seeing now is the new workloads start, in addition to highly intense optimization driven that we have. The third is perhaps more of a relative statement. Because of some of the work we’ve done in AI even in the last couple of quarters, we are now seeing conversations, whether it’s coming to you in just OpenAI’s APIs, right? If you think about the consumer tech companies that are all spinning essentially Azure meters, because they have gone to OpenAI and are using their API. These are not customers of Azure at all. Second, even Azure OpenAI API customers are all new and the workload conversations, whether it’s B2C conversations in financial services, or drug discovery on another side, these are all new workloads that we really were not in the game in the past, whereas we now are. Those are the three comments I would make, both in terms of absolute macro, but more importantly, I think what is our relative market position and how it’s being changed. AMY HOOD: That’s maybe the one thing I would add to those comments, is we’ve been through almost a year where that pivot that Satya talked about from we’re starting tons of new workloads – we’ll call that the pandemic time – to this transition post, and we’re coming to really the anniversary of that starting. And so, to Satya’s point, we’re continuing to incent optimization, but at some point, workloads just can’t be optimized much further. And when you start to anniversary that, you do see that it gets a little bit easier in terms of the comps, year over year. And so, you even see that in a little bit of our guidance, some of that impact from a year-over-year basis. MARK MOERDLER: That was incredibly helpful. I really do appreciate it. Thank you for the color, and again, congratulations on what’s happening. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. On Copilot monetization, can you just give us a sense of how this shows up, where we’re going to see it? And ultimately, is there a simple price lift that you think you can get through a copilot, say 10%, 20%, 30% above where you saw the regular components of the suite, or is it too hard to factor in? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, overall, we do plan to monetize a separate set of meters across all of the tech stack, whether they’re consumption meters or per-user subscriptions. The copilot that’s priced, and it is there, is GitHub Copilot. That’s a good example of incrementally how we monetize the price lists out there, and others are to be priced, because we are in preview mode. But you can expect us to do what we’ve done with GitHub Copilot pretty much across the board. AMY HOOD: Yeah, Brent, the best way of thinking about this is when we believe we’re adding a lot of value, and frankly, that’s what the copilots are doing and some productivity improvement, you can expect that we will have a list price for those. And you’ll be able to look at that as we get to release. And to Satya’s point, GitHub Copilot is a great example. BRENT THILL: Thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, we have the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Congrats from me as well. And just staying on the AI theme and more thinking about the gross margin impact on Azure, can you just, Satya, maybe talk a little bit about how you see the cost of compute for AI workloads versus kind of the classic workloads? And how do you think that will evolve over time? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, a couple of things. One is clearly, the accelerated compute is what gets used to drive AI. And the thing that we are very, very focused on is to make sure that we get very efficient in the usage of those resources. If you think about sort of what a hyperscaler does is not just rack and stack sort of hardware. They use software to optimize the performance of a given workload, and in fact heterogeneous workloads on a given set of hardware. And so, we have many knobs that will continue to drive optimization across it. And you see it even for a given generation of a large model, where we start with the cost footprint to where we end in the cost footprint, even in a period of a quarter, changes. So, you can expect us to do what we have done over the decade plus the public cloud to bring the benefits of, I would say, continuous optimization of our COGS to a diverse set of workloads. The other thing I would mention is that there are a lot of workloads now. One of the reasons why we got together with OpenAI primarily was we came out and said this type of workload, whether it’s a training or an inference workload, is going to be much more generally relevant for us, not just in the context of AI. And so, you can see, I’ll supply in other contexts as well. AMY HOOD: And Raimo, we talked a bit about this when we talked about the new Edge and the new Bing with analysts. And I think one of the important things to keep in mind, which Satya is pointing to, is that it’s not really just the cost of Azure and the ability to optimize across the Azure workloads. It’s that really, even our first-party workloads and apps that are built are built on the same platform. And we’re able, because we are a hyperscaler and because we have a large commercial cloud first party, as well as consumer apps like Bing that are first party, we’re able to take advantage of that and GPU utilization, AI services utilization across the stack. And so, it’s not just sort of where Satya wanted to see even a broader benefit of being a hyperscaler. RAIMO LENSCHOW: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Joe, next question, please. KEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Good afternoon. Good evening. Thank you for taking the question. Amy, I wanted to address this to you, if I could. On your prepared remarks, you commented that you thought that operating expense growth would be lower. I was hoping to just maybe flush that out with some broader comments. Excuse me. Could you talk about how you see any kind of directional color on how you see gross margins evolving, given mix, and particularly supporting generative AI, and/or any other comments that might help shape our thinking as we begin to look at the operating margin for the next fiscal year? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. And this is probably a good opportunity to explain a bit about how I think about where we are, which is you look at all of the businesses we’re in, and we look about our competitiveness in those businesses. And this is where Satya started to comment a bit about our relative performance versus absolute. And I’ll tell you that the energy and focus we put right now is on relative performance and share gains. Right now, we have the largest commercial cloud with increasing commitments by customers, with new workloads, new TAM opportunities that Satya’s talking about with customers. And our focus is going to be and will be on continuing to take a growing share of that, while we continue to focus on our customers’ success and getting a ton of value out of what we are selling, whether that’s the E5 product of Microsoft 365, whether that’s Windows 365 to help. Maybe it’s on compute costs and PC cost, whether it’s working across the Azure stack. And so, with that opportunity plus in our consumer business, the largest number of active devices we’ve had in Windows that are still being used more, being able to focus on Edge share, and Bing share and gaming, bringing it to the PC as well as across to mobile, these are the opportunities that we focus on, as we think about next year. And so, if we feel like, and I do, that we are well positioned to continue to take share in so many key places, then I say great. And we want to be able to focus on investing in AI, which I talked about. We’ll increase COGS growth, but we’re committed to making sure we have healthy profitability by keeping operating expenses low. And so, what really this past year has been about, but really what Q3 starts to show is our willingness to pivot to the future, to make sure we can keep all those commitments that Satya listed. While I know that’s not giving specificity, it is in fact how we think about long-term success, is being well-positioned in big markets, taking share in those markets, committing to make sure we’re going to lead this wave, staying focused on gross margin improvements where we can. Some of them will come in AI over time, given our commitment to the buildout. We will charge for those AI capabilities, and then ultimately, we’ll deliver operating profit. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, just to add to it, during these periods of transition, the way I think, as shareholders, you may want to look at is what’s the opportunity set ahead when we have a differentiated play to go after that opportunity set, which we believe we have, both the opportunity set in terms of TAM is bigger, and our differentiation at the very start of a cycle, we feel we have a good lead, and we have differentiated offerings up and down the stack. And so, therefore, that’s the sort of approach we’re going to take, which is how do we maximize the return of that starting position for you all, as shareholders, long term? That’s sort of where we look at it. And we’ll manage the P&L carefully, driving operating leverage in a disciplined way, but not being shy of investing where we need to invest, in order to grab the long-term opportunity. And so, obviously we will see share gains first, usage first, then GM, then OPInc, right, like a classic P&L flow, but we feel good about our position. KEITH BACHMAN: All right, many thanks for the answer. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks. We’ve had a lot of questions on AI and Azure, so maybe just to round it out, just on the Office 365 business, Amy, 16% constant currency guide for June, not really seeing much seat degradation despite obviously a tight labor market. So, it’s proven to be very resilient. Could you just unpack the sensitivity to that headcount reduction, given that across your customer base, at least slower rate of hiring, just given that this is an enormous seat based business, it doesn’t seem to be showing up? Maybe you could just help us understand what’s driving that continued seat growth and how durable that is. AMY HOOD: Yeah. Thanks, Karl. I think I would step back and say we have seen, I mean, the Office 365 suite, but broadly, the Microsoft 365 suite adds a ton of value for users. And so, if you think about the users and on the global base, we’ve been able to add users, which you continue to see, we still have in the frontline scenario and an SMB opportunity to continue to grow. And in the enterprise, where we are a basic productivity tool, the labor market is still tight in those places. And we continue to see customers committed to the value they’re getting. And so, this is not something that I think our focus has really been on continuing to get healthy renewals, continuing to add new products and renewal where it makes sense to save customers money and increase value. And so, I think that’s the story of the resilience you’re seeing. And, of course, we did have a good E5 quarter, which you’re starting to see, and it helps on RPU. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please. RISHI JALURIA, RBC: Wonderful. Hi, Satya. Hi, Amy. Thanks so much for taking my question. Nice to see continued resilience in the business. I wanted to get back to the topic of AI, but think maybe a little bit longer term. How are you thinking about the potential for regulation around AI, some of the concerns around data, and customer privacy and governance? And what do you think you can do to maybe quell some of those fears that governments, and customers and organizations have around that? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. Thanks, Rishi, for the question. Overall, we’ve taken the approach that we are not waiting for regulation to show up. We are taking an approach where the unintended consequences of any new technology is something that, from day one, we think about as first class, and build into our engineering process all the safeguards. For example, in 2016 is when we put out the AI principles. We translated the AI principles into a set of internal standards that then are further translated into an implementation process, that then we hold ourselves to internal audit, essentially. That’s the framework we have. We have a Chief AI Officer who is sort of responsible for both thinking of what the standards are, and then the people who even help us internally audit our following of the process. And so, we feel very good in terms of us being able to create trust in the systems we put out there. And so, we will obviously engage with any regulation that comes up in any jurisdiction. But quite honestly, we think that the more there is any form of trust as a differentiated position in the AI, I think we stand to gain from that. RISHI JALURIA: All right. Wonderful. Thank you so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Rishi. Joe, we have time for one last question. MICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: Hey, great. Thanks. I appreciate you squeezing me in. I want to ask a question on the consolidation play that Microsoft is positioned for, given that’s something we hear clearly top of mind for IP decision makers currently. You have clear plays across security infrastructure apps in other areas. So, it would just be great to hear your view on the Microsoft consolidation playbook in the current environment, and if there are certain areas you’re particularly focused on or seeing the most traction around. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I’ll start, and then, Amy, you can add. I think Amy referenced this in the context of Microsoft 365 and Office 365, but fundamentally, what we’re focused on is making sure that the customers are able to derive the value out of our offerings, whether it’s the Microsoft 365 suite value, which is significant, whether it’s E3 or E5. And we want to make sure that they’re getting deployed, they’re getting used. And that’s obviously going to lead to our share gains in many cases. Same thing in security. That’s a place where this quarter, you saw some good results from us. And same all up and down the stack across Azure. When you think about AI, the anatomy of an AI application is not just an AI model. In fact, ChatGPT itself is a great example. ChatGPT, for example, uses Cosmos DB as their core database. And so, therefore, we want to make sure that our services, as they are competitive, get used together, whether it’s the IaaS layer, or the PaaS layer, or the SaaS layer. AMY HOOD: And maybe one thing I would add, Michael, is that I know the question is consolidation, but another aspect of that is that some of the new business process automation work that’s going to get done, whether that’s the Dynamics workloads that we’ve talked about, it also will benefit from having the AI services available in Azure, from having the core Azure capabilities, as well actually some front end stuff that people are buying in Microsoft 365 to close these loops in a new way. And so, I think maybe it’s not the traditional definition of consolidation, but when people look and say, what vendor adds a lot of value and has the tools that we need, and in many instances already own, to be able to do this business process work, I think we have a great, great value, and frankly, probably leading tools in almost every vertical. MICHAEL TURRIN: Great, thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Michael. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, all. Thanks so much. END"
MSFT,2023,2,2023-01-24T12:00:00-00:00, "Microsoft FY23 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, January 24, 2023 BRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's second quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brett. I want to start with the context I shared with our employees last week on the changing environment and our priorities. As I meet with customers and partners, a few things are increasingly clear: Just as we saw customers accelerate their digital spend during the pandemic, we’re now seeing them optimize that spend. Also, organizations are exercising caution given the macroeconomic uncertainty. And the next major wave of computing is being born, as we turn the world’s most advanced AI models into a new computing platform. In this environment, we remain convicted on three things: This is an important time for Microsoft to work with our customers helping them realize more value from their tech spend and building long term loyalty and share position, while internally aligning our own cost structure with our revenue growth. This in turn sets us up to participate in the secular trend where digital spend as a percentage of GDP is only going to increase. And lastly we’re going to lead in the AI era, knowing that maximum enterprise value gets created during platform shifts. With that as the backdrop, the Microsoft Cloud exceeded $27 billion in quarterly revenue, up 22 percent and 29 percent in constant currency. Now, I’ll highlight examples of our innovation, starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for any customer in today’s economy to mitigate demand uncertainty and energy costs, while gaining efficiencies of cloud-native development. Enterprises have moved millions of cores to Azure, and run twice as many cores on our cloud today than they did two years ago. And yet we are still in the early innings when it comes to the long-term cloud opportunity. As an example, insurer AIA was able to save more than 20 percent by migrating to Azure, and reduced IT provisioning times from multiple months to just an hour. We also continue to lead with hybrid computing, with Azure Arc. We now have more than 12,000 Arc customers, double the number a year ago, including companies like Citrix, Northern Trust, and PayPal. Now, on to data. Customers continue to choose and implement the Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform over the competition because of its comprehensiveness, integration, and lower cost. Bayer, for example, used the data stack to evaluate results from clinical trials faster and more efficiently, while meeting regulatory requirements. And ASOS chose Cosmos DB to power real-time product recommendations and order processing for over 26 million global customers. Now, on to AI. The age of AI is upon us, and Microsoft is powering it. We are witnessing non-linear improvements in capability of foundation models, which we are making available as platforms. And as customers select their cloud providers and invest in new workloads, we are well positioned to capture that opportunity as a leader in AI. We have the most powerful AI supercomputing infrastructure in the cloud. It’s being used by customers and partners, like OpenAI, to train state of the art models and services, including ChatGPT. Just last week, we made Azure OpenAI Service broadly available, and already over 200 customers – from KPMG to Al Jazeera – are using it. We will soon add support for ChatGPT, enabling customers to use it in their own applications for the first time. And yesterday we announced the completion of the next phase of our agreement with OpenAI. We’re pleased to be their exclusive cloud provider and will deploy their models across our consumer and enterprise products as we continue to push the state of the art in AI. All of this innovation is driving growth across our Azure AI services. Azure ML revenue alone has increased more than 100 percent for five quarters in a row, with companies like AXA, FedEx, and H&R Block choosing the service to deploy, manage, and govern their models. Now, on to developers. Modernizing applications is mission-critical to any company’s operations today. And with GitHub, Visual Studio, and our Azure PaaS services, we have the most comprehensive portfolio of tools to help. GitHub is now home to 100 million developers. And GitHub Copilot is the first at-scale AI product built for this era, fundamentally transforming developer productivity. More than one million people have used Copilot to date. This quarter, we brought Copilot to businesses, and we’ve seen strong interest and early adoption from companies including Duolingo, Lemonade, and Volkswagen’s CARIAD software group. Now, on to Power Platform. Power Platform is becoming an essential digital transformation tool as every business looks to streamline their operations and drive productivity in today’s environment. We are helping customers realize superior time to value with our end-to-end suite, spanning low-code/no-code tools, automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. We are leading in robotic process automation. Power Automate has more than 45,000 customers – from AT&T to Rabobank – up over 50 percent year-over-year. And we’re making it easier for anyone to streamline repetitive tasks, introducing new AI-powered features to turn natural language prompts into complex workflows. Now, on to business applications. Dynamics 365 is taking share, as we help businesses digitize their service, finance, customer experience, and supply chain functions. For example, G&J Pepsi-Cola Bottlers is moving from reactive to predictive field service. Fujifilm is optimizing its operations. Investec is closing deals faster with conversational intelligence. Baylor, Scott & White in Texas is using our Digital Contact Center Platform to enhance patient communications. And this quarter, we introduced our new Supply Chain Platform, helping customers like iFit and Kraft-Heinz apply AI to predict and mitigate disruptions. Now, on to industry solutions. Our industry and cross-industry clouds are driving pull-through for our entire tech stack. Our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF last week, as we introduced new tools to help retailers manage their day-to-day operations and digitize their physical stores. Polish retailer Zabka has built the largest chain of autonomous stores in Europe with the help of our technology. In financial services, our new partnership with the London Stock Exchange Group will deliver next-generation of data, analytics, and workspace solutions. And in healthcare, we are rapidly becoming the partner of choice for any provider looking to generate real value from AI. With Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, physicians can reduce documentation time by half, improving the quality of their patient interactions. Now, on to systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva are essential for every organization to adapt to the new world of work. Microsoft 365 is rapidly evolving into an AI-first platform that enables every individual to amplify their creativity and productivity, with both our established applications, as well as new apps like Designer, Stream, and Loop. We have more than 63 million consumer subscribers, up 12 percent year-over-year, and we introduced Microsoft 365 “Basic,” bringing our premium offerings to more people. Teams surpassed 280 million monthly active users this quarter, showing durable momentum since the pandemic. And we continue to take share across every category, from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling. Teams has emerged as a first-class platform. Apps from Adobe, Atlassian, Polly, ServiceNow, and Workday have each surpassed half a million active users, and the number of third-party apps with more than 10,000 users increased nearly 40 percent year-over-year. There are more than 500,000 active Teams Rooms devices, up 70 percent year-over-year. And the number of customers with more than 1,000 rooms doubled year-over-year. Novo Nordisk will deploy Teams Rooms to 5,000 meeting rooms globally, in our largest deal to date. Teams Phone continues to take share and is the market leader in cloud calling. We’ve added more than 5 million PSTN seats over the last 12 months alone. With Teams Premium, we’re meeting enterprise demand for advanced features like end-to-end encryption and AI-powered recaps. We’ve seen strong interest in preview, and we will make it broadly available next month. With Microsoft Viva, we’ve created a new market category for employee experience and organizational productivity. US Bank is using Viva to streamline employee communications. And Carlsberg turned to Viva to centralize its digital employee experience for 29,000 employees. In today’s environment, aligning the entire organization on the most important work is critical. Viva Goals brings objectives and key results directly into the flow of daily work. Viva has also become an indispensable tool for business process. Viva Sales is the “super app” in Microsoft 365 for sellers. We’ve seen strong interest since making it generally available this quarter. All-up, we continue to see organizations consolidate on Microsoft 365. Eighty percent of our enterprise customers use five or more Microsoft 365 applications. And organizations across the private and public sector, including EY, Ikea, NTT Communications, Rio Tinto, as well as the state government of Virginia are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. While the number of PCs shipped declined during the quarter, returning to pre-pandemic levels, usage intensity of Windows continues to be higher than pre-pandemic, with time spent per PC up nearly 10 percent. Monthly active devices also reached an all-time high this quarter. And for commercial customers, Windows 11 adoption continues to grow because of its differentiated security and productivity value proposition. We’re also seeing growth in cloud-delivered Windows, with usage of Windows 365 and Azure Virtual Desktop up by over two-thirds year-over-year. Leaders in every industry, from Campari and Grant Thornton UK, to Nutrien and Woolworths, are using cloud-delivered Windows, including more than 60 percent of the Fortune 500. Now, on to security. Over the past 12 months, our security business surpassed $20 billion in revenue, as we help customers protect their digital estate across clouds and endpoint platforms. We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning identity, security, compliance, device management, and privacy, informed and trained on over 65 trillion signals each day. We are taking share across all the major categories we serve. Customers are consolidating on our security stack, in order to reduce risk, complexity, and cost. The number of organizations with four or more workloads increased over 40 percent year-over-year. UK retailer Fraser’s Group, for example, consolidated from 10 security vendors to just Microsoft. Roku moved identity and access management to the cloud with Azure Active Directory. And Astella Pharma, Ferrovial, and University of Toronto all switched to Microsoft Sentinel because of our integrated XDR and SIEM capabilities. Now, on to LinkedIn. People and companies continue to look to LinkedIn to connect, learn, sell, and get hired. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 900 million members. Three members are signing up every second. Over eighty percent of these members are from outside the United States. And as the members come to the platform to find and share professional knowledge and expertise, newsletter creation was up 10X year-over-year. Skills are the new currency, and people are increasingly investing in their skill-building to keep up with their changing roles and industries. We offer more than 20,000 courses in 11 languages. And companies are also turning to a skills-based approach, in place of degree or pedigree, to identify qualified talent, with more than 45 percent of hirers on LinkedIn explicitly using skills data to fill their roles. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to be a leader in B2B digital advertising, helping companies deliver the right message, to the right audience, on a safe and trusted platform. Now, on to advertising. Despite headwinds in the ad market, we continue to innovate across our first- and third-party portfolios. Our browser, Microsoft Edge, gained share for the seventh consecutive quarter. Bing continues to gain share in the United States. And daily users of our Start personalized content feed increased over 30 percent year-over-year. We’re now empowering retailers and expanding our third-party inventory. With Promote IQ, we are building a complete omnichannel media platform for companies like the Australian retailer Endeavour, as well as Canada’s Hudson’s Bay. And Globo, the largest Brazilian TV broadcaster, chose Xandr to launch a new media buying platform in that market. Now, on to gaming. In gaming, we continue to pursue our ambition to give players more choice to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want. We saw new highs for Game Pass subscriptions, game streaming hours, and monthly active devices. And monthly active users surpassed a record 120 million during the quarter. We continue to invest to add value to Game Pass. This quarter, we partnered with Riot Games to make the company’s PC and mobile games, along with premium content, available to subscribers. And, finally, we’re energized by our upcoming lineup of AAA game launches, including exciting new titles from ZeniMax and Xbox Game Studios. And we’ll be sharing details and game play at our showcase tomorrow. In closing, I want to extend my deepest gratitude to our employees for their continued dedication to our mission, customers, and partners. We will continue to pursue our long-term opportunity and innovation agenda with urgency, while raising the bar on our operational excellence. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. I’d like to start by reiterating Satya’s thoughts on the changing environment and our priorities, which underpin the decisions communicated in last week’s announcement. The resulting Q2 charge negatively impacted gross margin by $152 million, operating income by $1.2 billion, and earnings per share by $0.12. Our second quarter revenue was $52.7 billion, up 2 percent and 7 percent in constant currency. When adjusted for the charge, gross margin dollars increased 2 percent and 8 percent in constant currency. Operating income decreased 3 percent and increased 6 percent in constant currency. And earnings per share was $2.32 cents – which decreased 6 percent and increased 2 percent in constant currency. In our consumer business, the PC market was in line with our expectations, but execution challenges impacted our Surface business. Advertising spend declined slightly more than expected, which impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. In our commercial business, we delivered strong growth in line with our expectations. However, as you heard from Satya, we are seeing customers exercise caution in this environment, and we saw results weaken thru December. We saw moderated consumption growth in Azure and lower-than-expected growth in new business across the standalone Office 365, EMS, and Windows Commercial products that are sold outside the Microsoft 365 suite. From a geographic perspective, we saw strong execution in many regions around the world, however performance in the US was weaker than expected. Importantly, we continued to see share gains in areas such as Data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, Security, and Edge. Commercial bookings increased 7 percent and 4 percent in constant currency, lower than expected. Consistent execution across our renewal sales motions including strong recapture rates and growth in Azure commitments on a high prior year comparable were partially offset by the slowdown in growth of new standalone business noted earlier. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 29 percent and 26 percent in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 24 percent year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 32 percent. Our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96 percent. FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points, in line with expectations. At a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by 6 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. FX impact on Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing were both in line with expectations. Additionally, FX decreased both COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $27.1 billion and grew 22 percent and 29 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 72 percent, a point better than expected driven by lower energy costs. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point primarily driven by sales mix shift to Azure. Company gross margin percentage was 67 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points driven by a lower mix of OEM revenue and sales mix shift from licensing to cloud. Operating expense, when adjusted for the Q2 charge, increased 11 percent and 13 percent in constant currency, about $500 million lower than expected. Operating expense growth was driven by investments in cloud engineering, the Nuance acquisition, and LinkedIn. At a total company level, headcount ended December 19 percent higher than a year ago. Sequential headcount growth was less than 1 percent. Year-over-year growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Adjusted for the charge, operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 41 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points primarily driven by unfavorable FX impact, as well as a lower mix of Windows OEM revenue. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $17 billion and grew 7 percent and 13 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations when excluding the favorable FX impact noted earlier. Office commercial revenue grew 7 percent and 14 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11 percent and 18 percent in constant currency, slightly better than expected with healthy renewal execution and ARPU growth as E5 momentum remains strong. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 12 percent year-over-year with installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments. Seat growth was driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings - although we saw some impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. Office consumer revenue declined 2 percent and increased 3 percent in constant currency with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 12 percent to 63.2 million, partially offset by declines in our transactional business. LinkedIn revenue increased 10 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, driven by growth in Talent Solutions partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Dynamics revenue grew 13 percent and 20 percent in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 21 percent and 29 percent in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8 percent and 16 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 12 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, including roughly 5 points from the Q2 charge. Operating income increased 6 percent and 17 percent in constant currency, as the 3 points of favorable impact due to the change in accounting estimate were offset by 3 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $21.5 billion, increasing 18 percent and 24 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 31 percent and 38 percent in constant currency. As noted earlier, growth continued to moderate particularly in December and we exited the quarter with Azure constant currency growth in the mid 30s. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 16 percent to over 241 million seats with impact from the slowdown in growth of new business noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2 percent and increased 2 percent in constant currency, with continued hybrid demand offset by weakness in transactional licensing. Enterprise Services revenue grew 2 percent and 7 percent in constant currency. Segment gross margin dollars increased 17 percent and 23 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs. Operating expenses increased 34 percent and 37 percent in constant currency, including roughly 13 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and roughly 7 points of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Operating income grew 7 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, as roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate was offset by approximately 7 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.2 billion, decreasing 19 percent and 16 percent in constant currency, below expectations driven by Surface, Windows Commercial, and Search. Windows OEM revenue decreased 39 percent year-over-year, in line with expectations. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 36 percent on a strong prior year comparable. Devices revenue decreased 39 percent and 34 percent in constant currency, below expectations due to execution challenges on new product launches. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue declined 3 percent and increased 3 percent in constant currency, lower than expected primarily due to the slowdown in growth of new business in standalone offerings noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC increased 10 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, a bit lower than expected as noted earlier. Our Edge browser gained more share than expected this quarter. The Xandr acquisition contributed roughly 6 points of benefit. And in Gaming, revenue declined 13 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 13 percent and 9 percent in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 12 percent and 8 percent in constant currency given the strong first party content last year. Segment gross margin dollars declined 29 percent and 24 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 7 points year-over-year driven by lower Devices gross margin and sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 6 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier and 3 points of impact from the Xandr acquisition. Operating income decreased 47 percent and 40 percent in constant currency, including roughly 6 points of unfavorable impact from the Q2 charge noted earlier. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.8 billion to support cloud demand. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $11.2 billion, down 23 percent year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were more than offset by a tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision as well as higher employee and supplier payments. Free cash flow was $4.9 billion, down 43 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations declined 7 percent and free cash flow declined 16 percent. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $60 million, lower than anticipated driven by a mark-to-market loss on a forward share purchase agreement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19 percent. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q3 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we continue to work towards closing in fiscal year 2023, subject to obtaining required regulatory approvals. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 3 points, COGS growth by 1 point, and operating expense growth by 2 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 4 points of negative impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 3 points in Intelligent Cloud and 2 points in More Personal Computing. In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Devices will see continued declines as the PC market returns to pre-pandemic levels. And, LinkedIn and Search will be impacted as ad market spending remains a bit cautious. In our commercial business, we expect the business trends that we saw at the end of December to continue into Q3. While customers are more cautious in their spend, we also have the opportunity to improve our execution given our strong position in durable growth markets. In commercial bookings, with a declining expiry base and a strong prior year comparable in terms of large Azure contracts, we expect growth to be relatively flat year-over-year. We expect consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and continued commitments to our platform will be offset by impact from the slowdown of new business noted earlier and 3 points of unfavorable impact from the inclusion of Nuance in the prior year. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q3 cloud gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point driven by Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Our data center investments continue to be based on near-term and longer-term customer demand, including AI opportunities. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11 and 13 percent in constant currency or $16.9 to $17.2 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly one point on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the mid 20s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue growth in the low-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect mid-single digits revenue growth with continued strong engagement on the platform, although impacted by the advertising trends noted earlier and a slowdown in hiring, particularly in the technology industry where we have significant exposure. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-teens driven by continued growth in Dynamics 365 which is now over 80 percent of total Dynamics revenue. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 17 and 19 percent in constant currency or $21.7 to $22 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect continued moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. As I noted earlier, we exited Q2 with Azure growth in the mid 30s in constant currency and from that, we expect Q3 growth to decelerate roughly 4 to 5 points in constant currency. FX impact in Azure is about a point more than at the segment level. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, revenue should decline low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $11.9 to $12.3 billion. Windows OEM revenue should decline in the mid-to-high 30s in line with the PC market. We expect Q3 PC units to be similar to pre-pandemic levels. In Devices, revenue should decline in the mid 40s, as we work through the execution challenges noted earlier. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue should be relatively flat as customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions will be partially offset by the slowdown in new business noted earlier. Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow high-single digits, roughly 7 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by continued volume strength supported by Edge browser share gains and the inclusion of Xandr. And in Gaming, on a prior year comparable that benefited from increased console supply, we expect revenue to decline in the high-single digits. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-single digits as growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions will be more than offset by lower monetization per hour in third-party and first-party content. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 1 and 2 percent in constant currency or to be between $15.65 and $15.85 billion and operating expenses to grow between 11 and 12 percent in constant currency or be $14.7 to $14.8 billion. Other income and expense should be roughly $200 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. We expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent. And finally, as a reminder for Q3 cash flow, we expect to make a $1.2 billion cash tax payment related to the TCJA capitalization of R&D provision. Now some thoughts on H2 and the full year. First, in our commercial business, revenue grew 20 percent on a constant currency basis in H1, however, we now expect to see a deceleration in H2 given how we exited December. Next, higher energy costs for the full year are now expected to be $500 million compared to our previous estimate of $800 million. Third, as we continue to prioritize our investments and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, our Q4 operating expense growth should be in the low single digits in constant currency. Finally, we remain committed to operational excellence, aligning costs and growth, investing in our customer’s success, and leading the AI platform wave. As a result, when excluding the Q2 charge and favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, we expect full year operating margins to be down roughly 1 point in constant currency and roughly 2 points in USD, even with the headwinds from materially lower OEM revenue and higher energy costs. In the first half of the year, over 70 percent of our revenue came from our commercial business, and over 70 percent of that from Microsoft Cloud. We have a resilient foundation in durable growth markets where we are gaining share. I’m confident in the ability of our Microsoft team to manage the near-term while continuing to position ourselves for the future. With that, let’s go to Q&A. Brett? BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to the Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Joe, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys for taking the question. I was hoping we could delve into the expansion of the investment into OpenAI. And Satya, I was hoping to talk to us about, is there any expansion in the scope of what you guys are doing with OpenAI, and the commitment that you guys are making in terms of sort of the compute capacity you’re going to be given to them? And then maybe, from an investor’s perspective, how should we think about when this functionality is going to expand beyond just sort of the Azure OpenAI services, and when we’re going to start to see some of the positive impacts to perhaps Bing or the productivity suite, or more broadly across the solution portfolio? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so much, Keith, for the questions. As you know, we started the OpenAI partnership now three and a half years ago. And we’ve been actually working very hard on a lot of elements of this partnership over the last three years. And so, I think the way for our investors to see this is we fundamentally believe that the next big platform wave, as I said, is going to be AI. And we strongly also believe a lot of the enterprise value gets created by just being able to catch these waves, and then have those waves impact every part of our tech stack, and also create new solutions and new opportunities. Whenever we think about platform opportunities and platform shift opportunities, that’s how we come at it. How can we essentially ride the wave for everything that we have today and make it more expansive? And then what new can be created? If you take that lens, the core of Azure or what is considered cloud computing fundamentally changes in its nature and how compute, storage and network come together. That’s, in some sense, under the radar, if you will. For the last three and a half, four years, we’ve been working very, very hard to build both the training supercomputers, and now of course, the inference infrastructure, because once you use AI inside of your applications, it goes from just being training heavy to inference. That’s sort of, I think, core Azure itself has been transformed and the infrastructure business is being transformed. And so, you can see us with data beyond Azure OpenAI services, even. Think about what Synapse plus OpenAI API’s can do. You already have the Power Platform incorporated capability. You can prompt a workflow. I mean, one of the reasons why we’re the leaders in robotic process automation and workflow automation today is because of some of the AI capabilities that we have in there. GitHub Copilot is, in fact, I would say the most at-scale LLF-based product out there in the marketplace today. And so, we fully expect us to sort of incorporate AI in every layer of the stack, whether it’s in productivity, whether it’s in our consumer services. And so, we’re excited about it, but I think that we’re also excited about OpenAI’s own innovation, right? They commercialized their products. We’re excited about the ChatGPT being built on Azure and having the traction it has. We look to both there is an investment part to it and there’s a commercial partnership, but fundamentally, it’s going to be something that’s going to drive, I think, innovation and competitive differentiation in every one of the Microsoft solutions by leading in AI. KEITH WEISS: Thank you, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Satya, can you give us your overall macro view? There were some comments you had made that concerned, I think, many about the state of the U.S. spending environment. I’m just curious if you could comment and follow up on what you’re seeing there, just from the spend environment throughout the year. I think many came away with that perceiving that you were saying it’s getting worse, not better. Can you just give us a little more color on that? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brent. First of all, I was making a comment which was sort of a global comment, not just a specific U.S. comment. I mean, I always sort of subscribe to that there’s only one law of gravity that I think all of us are subject to, which is inflation-adjusted economic growth in the world, and then how many times that do we grow, because, as I said, even I fundamentally believe tech as a percentage of GDP is going to be much higher, and on a secular basis. The question is, how many times is it, given the overall inflation adjusted economic growth? That’s kind of how I look at it. Given that, I think the two things that we see, we commented on that even in the last quarter, and it’s even in the outlook, which is the thing that customers are doing is what they accelerated during the pandemic, they’re making sure that they’re getting most value out of it or optimizing it, and then also being a bit more cautious on, given the macroeconomic headwinds out there in the market. Given those two things, the point is at some point, the optimizations will end. In fact, the money that they save in any optimization of any workload is what they’ll plow into workloads. And those workloads will start ramping up. And so, one of the key things we’re watching for, Brent, is to make sure that we are gaining share in this phase through our value propositions, and even build loyalty with our customers so that, long term, we are well positioned for share gain. That’s sort of fundamentally how we view it. And then the other aspect, I’d also say, is simultaneously investing in this new AI trend, because I don’t think any application start that happens next is going to look like the application starts of 2019 or 2020. They’re all going to have considerations around how does my AI inference performance cost model is going to look like. And that’s where we are well-positioned again. That’s how I view it. The market, you all are better readers of, quite frankly, what’s happening out there. We can tell you what we see. What we see is optimization and some cautious approach to new workloads. And that will cycle through, but we do fundamentally believe on a long-term basis as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is going to go up. BRENT THILL: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much. I’d like to follow up a little bit on this question relating to optimization. I know we saw some slowing this quarter, you’re guiding to some slowing next quarter in Cloud and Azure. How much of that is, do you believe at this point, truly people optimizing what they’ve already bought, and stepping back before that, versus how much of that is due to macro-factors themselves specifically impacting demand? SATYA NADELLA: I’d say two things, and then, Amy, please feel free to add. One is it absolutely starts with workloads that they have at scale, just because of the visibility one has on what’s driving, essentially, the consumption meters. And there’s real guidance that we ourselves entered in the product to say, here are things that you could do to optimize your billing. And so, that’s sort of what is the fundamental thing. When we say, do more with less, and how can we help, that’s sort of the first place customers go to. And then the next piece really, I think, is going to be about how do they take the optimization that they get, and the savings they get in one workload, and what new project starts. And that’s where there’s a reprioritization. When should we start a new project? Those are the two things that are happening simultaneously. They don’t perfectly match, but one of the things is they’re looking to back some savings on some workloads, and then start. That’s where, I think, a little bit of what has to happen is a cycle time where the optimization cycle finishes, the projects start, and then the projects ramp. And I think that that’s what, at least on the cloud consumption side, you’re seeing. And on the per-user side, it’s slightly different, which is in per user, also, there was real acceleration in terms of purchases of per-user licenses, whether it is for knowledge workers or frontline workers. And again, they’re all now making sure that they’re all getting used, and the usage is going up. When we look at our Office 365 usage, all those numbers are up, year over year, in a substantial way. I gave you some of the Teams numbers. In fact, one of the things was what’ll happen to Teams usage after pandemic. Guess what? They’re up. And so, that’s good news. And now, once we cycle through that again, the seats will get added at premium. I’m very, very excited about Teams Pro coming out in a couple of weeks. And those are all things that we will be able to sort of use to ensure that the ARPU are also going up in value. AMY HOOD: And Mark, because I do think it’s actually quite hard to separate, from a driver perspective, how much is optimization versus macro, it’s all related when you start to say, what’s the best ROI I can get on every budget dollar I spend. And our job as a partner to so many of these customers is to help them do that. Satya talked a bit about Azure. Let me talk a little bit about the per user, where the way it showed itself is we had very high renewal rates, and very good suite performance at renewal, meaning what we tend to call internally recapture. While we had some more challenges on maybe a standalone sale of a new product, where the cycle is going to be a little longer, you’re going to have to show that cost savings. But the suite sale, the value in that showed itself in terms of strong E5. You can see the ARPU growth, and you can see the consistency, potentially, in both renewal rate and frankly within Microsoft 365 performance. MARK MOERDLER: Perfect, thank you very much. I appreciate it. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Satya, I’m curious if you could talk about how long the cycle time for optimization is. Are we talking a couple of quarters, three quarters or multiple years, because I do take your comment about that tech spending is percentage of global GDP going higher? If that were to happen, how do you frame the duration of this optimization that’s happening in the industry? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, I think that you have a workload, you optimize the workload, and you start a new workload. The thing that I would say is when you’re done with optimizing a workload is when you are done with the cycle. I think, if you sort of say, when did we enter this, we accelerated a bunch of workloads during the pandemic over a period of two years. We are optimizing. I don’t think we’re going to take two years to optimize. But we’re going to take this year to optimize and then, as we optimize, the new project start. The new project starts don’t start instantly at the peak usage. They start and then they scale. And so, those are the two cycles that will happen, where there will be a time block. KASH RANGAN: Got it. It’s a temporary adjustment before we start to get the full effect of the next set of workloads. Good to get that. SATYA NADELLA: That’s correct, that’s correct. KASH RANGAN: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. This one for Amy. Amy, given the obviously tough environment, it sounds like reaching that full fiscal year 20% constant currency commercial revs guide would be tough. Is that also true for the soft guidance for 10% plus total revenue growth for the year? And if I could just sneak in a clarification, Amy, just because it’s an important metric, when you talk about a 4-to-5 point decel in Azure, that’s off of the 38% reported for December, right, not off the 35% exit rate? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Karl, the first half of your question, give me a second on the second half of your question, which is, is the guide off the exit rate? It’s off the exit rate on Azure of 4 to 5 points, just to make sure that is clear. In terms of thinking about total year revenue, you’re right, I did not comment on full year revenue as we continue, I think, really just to watch the Windows PC market as it returns to pre-pandemic levels. Outside of that, as you can see, the trends are relatively consistent. In some ways, it’s important because when you look at the operating income margin guidance that I talked about, the fact that we’re guiding to really only 1 point of margin deceleration for the year on a constant currency basis, with probably over $2 billion of headwind from the OEM business from what we had anticipated heading into the year, the focus on margins, the focus on prioritization, the focus on putting our investments into where we know they have high return, I actually feel quite good about the place that puts us in, as we exit the year in terms of in the right energy we’re leaving the year in Q4 on leverage. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. Super helpful. Thanks, Amy. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great, thanks very much. Amy, I wanted to ask about the expense actions that you announced last week, obviously, not a decision that you would take lightly. How are you thinking about headcount for the remainder of the year and the possibility for further expense actions, if necessary? And what criteria do you consider in making these decisions? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Brad, listen, thanks for that question. Obviously, as we think about the Q4 guidance around low single-digit operating expense growth, we start to, as you know, sort of lap certain real acceleration points that we had last year, and we lap the acquisitions, both of Nuance and Xander. By the time that gets to the end of Q4, you’ll see very moderated headcount growth on a year over year basis, in addition to some of the prioritization decisions we’ve made. And you’re right, we take decisions like the one we had to make to get our cost structure more in line with revenue just incredibly seriously, because we have lots of very talented people who were impacted by that. And so, I do think that we feel confident in that exit rate. As I said, it’ll certainly imply that year over year growth as we lap some of the investment that we made will be quite small. BRAD ZELNICK: Thanks for the color. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Joe, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD REBACK, Stifel: Great, thanks very much. In Office 365 Commercial, with you guys approaching 400 million seats and the E5 business really starting to accelerate here on that consolidated sort of expense ROI that you’re putting forth, should we think about the growth they’re more evenly balanced between seats and ARPU, going forward, or are we still to continue to favor seats? Thanks. AMY HOOD: That’s a good question, especially because this quarter, you started to see a little bit more of that ARPU influence. And as you might have gathered from your question, and I’ll just reinforce it, as we see some of these moderating seat growth, whether that’s some of the new SKU weakness that we had talked about, some of the standalone stuff, you’re starting to also see E5 ARPU happen at the same time. It does create some stability in that Office 365 Commercial revenue number. We’re seeing still good seat growth, still growth across all workloads. And, as you’re pointing out, we’re getting further into the E5 health, where we’ve seen, I want to say, four or five really good quarters of E5 adoption. The value there is just very high for customers in this environment, between analytics, security, and I think we’ve given some, I think, good security data points in terms of adoption, and voice. This is a place where customers can save money by moving to this suite. And I do think you’re starting to see some of that ARPU help. SATYA NADELLA: And we are also investing in, outside of Microsoft 365, other per-user workloads, Viva being a new suite, Power Platform on its own, and even standalone offers, like even Teams Pro and what have you. There’s a significant amount of work we want to do besides the sort of the suites that we all sort of have at scale. BRAD REBACK: Great. Thank you very much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Joe, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) TYLER RADKE, CITI: Yes, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask just about how your visibility has changed in terms of some of the larger Azure customer ramps. Could you just comment to the extent those large customer ramps or if any of those projects are getting put on pause? And then is there any way to just kind of quantify the AI potential contribution or maybe GPU-powered contribution to Azure that you’re expecting over the coming quarters? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: On the second piece, I think it’s too early to sort of start somehow separating out AI from the rest of the workload. I mean, even the workloads themselves, AI is just going to be a core part of a workload in Azure versus just AI alone. In other words, if you have an application that’s using a bunch of inference, let’s say, it’s also going to have a bunch of storage, and it’s going to have a bunch of other compute beyond GPU inferencing, if you will. I think over time, obviously, I think every app is going to be an AI app. That’s, I think, the best way to think about this transformation. On your characterization of the large customers, whether there is any changes in that trajectory, I would point back to, I think, some of the common theme around every large customer is looking to optimize the workload that they have at scale today, and plow some of that money back that they save into new project structure. That’s sort of what the classic pattern of large customers is. Sometimes, you will have ISVs who are different, right? If an ISV is optimizing, they optimize and say, what is the new set of features to add at what ramp. All that said, as Amy noted in her remarks, last quarter we added more long-term customer commitments to Azure, and it’s great to see that continue.* BRETT IVERSEN: That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. (Operator Direction.) END OF AUDIO *Complete answer included in transcript but not captured in the webcast " 
MSFT,2023,1,2022-10-25T12:00:00-00:00,"Microsoft FY23 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, October 25, 2022 BRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Satya Nadella, chairman and chief executive officer, Amy Hood, chief financial officer, Alice Jolla, chief accounting officer, and Keith Dolliver, deputy general counsel. On the Microsoft Investor Relations website, you can find our earnings press release and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared remarks during today’s call and provides the reconciliation of differences between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. On this call we will discuss certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. They are included as additional clarifying items to aid investors in further understanding the company's first quarter performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates in constant currency, when available, as a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following the call until the complete transcript is available. Today's call is being webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording. You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brett. To start, I want to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic times: First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term secular trend, where digital technology as a percentage of the world’s GDP will continue to increase. Second, we will prioritize helping our customers get the most value out of their digital spend, so that they can do more with less. And, finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure. With that context, this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue, up 24 percent and 31 percent in constant currency. And, based on current trends continuing, we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20 percent in constant currency this fiscal year, as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting our consumer business. With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We’re also seeing more customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services – including containerized applications – across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud environments. We now have more than 8,500 Arc customers, more than double the number a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich RE, Sodexo, Volvo Cars all run SAP on Azure. We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle databases running in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, making it possible for companies like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And, with Azure Confidential Computing, we’re enabling companies in highly regulated industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the cloud. Just last week, UBS said it will move more than 50 percent of its applications to Azure. Now, to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, helping customers cut “integration tax” associated with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world’s most-demanding workloads, at limitless scale. Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud provider to offer a database service that supports both relational and NoSQL workloads. And, in AI, we are turning the world’s most advanced models into platforms for customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dall-E to Azure OpenAI service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation model to commercial use cases for the first time. And Azure Machine Learning provides industry leading MLOps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage, and govern models. All-up, Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100 percent for four quarters in a row. Now, on to developers. We have the most complete platform for developers to build cloud-native applications. Four years since our acquisition, GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And GitHub’s developer-first ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service to build software for any cloud and any platform, up 3 times. GitHub Advanced Security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing features directly into developers’ workflows. Toyota North America chose the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its most critical applications. Now, on to Power Platform. We’re helping customers save time and money with our end-to-end suite, spanning low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. Power BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing faster than competition, as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for reporting and analytics. Power Apps is the market leader in low-code/no-code tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50 percent compared to a year ago. Power Automate has over 7 million monthly active users, and is being used by companies like Brown-Forman, Komatsu, Mars, T-Mobile to digitize manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And we’re going further, with new AI-powered capabilities in Power Automate that turn natural language into advanced workflows. Now, on to Dynamics 365. From customer experience and service, to finance and supply chain, we continue to take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lufthansa Cargo chose us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants. And, Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All-up, more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications. Now, on to industry solutions. We’re seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our Cloud for Financial Services to deliver new digital experiences for its customers. Our Cloud for Sustainability is off to a fast start, as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard to measure Scope 3 carbon emissions. And we’re seeing record growth in healthcare, driven in part by our Nuance DAX ambient intelligence solution, which automatically documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us DAX dramatically improves their productivity, and it’s quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader healthcare offerings. Now, on to new systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams, and Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today’s digitally connected, distributed world of work. Microsoft 365 is the cloud-first platform that supports all the ways people work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party content, as well as personalized recommendations. Microsoft Teams is the de facto standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. As we emerge from the pandemic, we are retaining users we’ve gained and are seeing increased engagement too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average. In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat than they do in e-mail, and the number of users who use four or more features within Teams increased over 20 percent year over year. Teams is becoming a ubiquitous platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60 percent year over year. And, over 55 percent of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams Rooms or Teams Phone. Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users have grown by double-digits for five quarters in a row. We’re bringing Teams Rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco’s devices and peripherals, which will now run Teams natively. And we’re creating a new category with Microsoft Places to help organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person work. Just like Outlook calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate, Places will do the same for where. We also announced Teams Premium, addressing enterprise demands for advanced meeting features, like additional security options and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Land O’Lakes to Rabobank, continue to turn to our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. We’ve also built a completely new suite with our employee experience platform Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20 million monthly active users at companies like Finastra, SES, and Unilever. And, we’re extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping salespeople at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system. Now, on to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues to see usage growth. All-up, there are nearly 20 percent more monthly active Windows devices than pre-pandemic. And, on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are spending 8.5 percent more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago. And, we’re seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employee PCs, up from just 25,000 seven months ago, and L’Oreal has deployed the operating system to 85,000 employees. Now, on to security. Security continues to be a top priority for every organization. We are the only company with integrated, end-to-end tools spanning security, compliance, identity, and device management, and privacy across all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry – from BP and Fujifilm, to ING Bank, iHeart Media, and Lumen Technologies – now use our security solutions, up 33 percent year over year. They can save up to 60 percent when they consolidate on our security stack, and the number of customers with more than 4 workloads have increased 50 percent year over year. More organizations are choosing both our XDR and cloud-native SIEM to secure their entire digital estate. The number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44 percent year over year. And as threats become more sophisticated, we’re innovating to protect customers. New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and manage security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity governance for both on-premises and cloud-based user directories. Now, on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members, with international growth increasing at nearly 2X the pace as in the Unites States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on LinkedIn, up 4X year over year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning help companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles over the last 12 months, up 43 percent year over year. And with our acquisition of EduBrite, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next generation Sales Navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal size by better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn Marketing Solutions continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising. More broadly, with Microsoft Advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any marketer or advertiser looking to innovate. We’ve expanded our geographies we serve by nearly 4X over the past year. We’re seeing record daily usage of Edge, Start, and Bing, driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest growing browser on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon and price comparison features to save money. We’ve surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date, and this quarter, we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our Start personalized content feed are consuming 2X more content, compared to a year ago. And we’re also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered by our technology and sales. And, with Promote IQ, we offer an omnichannel media platform for retailers like Otto Group looking to generate additional revenue, while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now, on to gaming. We’re adding new gamers to our ecosystem, as we execute on our ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want, on any device. We saw usage growth across all platforms, driven by strength off-console. PC Game Pass subscriptions increased 159 percent year over year. And with Cloud Gaming, we’re transforming how games are distributed, played, and viewed. More than 20 million people have used the service to stream games to date. And we’re adding support for new devices, like handhelds from Logitech and Razer, as well as Meta Quest. And, as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in gaming, with Game Pass, and Xbox Series S. Nearly half of the Series S buyers are new to our ecosystem. In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds, digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we’re innovating across the entire tech stack to help every organization, while also focusing intensely on our operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11 percent and 16 percent in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.35 – and increased 4 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, when adjusted for the net tax benefit from the first quarter of fiscal year 22. Driven by strong execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal year, in line with our expectations, even as we saw many of the macro trends from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken thru Q1. In our consumer business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted Search and news advertising and LinkedIn Marketing Solutions. As you heard from Satya, in our commercial business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings, with growth of 31 percent in constant currency as well as share gains across many businesses. Commercial bookings declined 3 percent and increased 16 percent in constant currency on a flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal execution and we continued to see growth in the number of large, long-term Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the 10-million-dollar-plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31 percent and 34 percent in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23 percent year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38 percent year-over-year. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96 percent. FX impacted company results in line with expectations. With the stronger US dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by 5 points. And at a segment level, FX decreased Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 6 points, and More Personal Computing revenue growth by 3 points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 3 points. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 73 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point driven by sales mix shift to Azure and lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs. Company gross margin dollars increased 9 percent and 16 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69 percent. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier, and Nuance. Operating expense increased 15 percent and 18 percent in constant currency driven by investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance and commercial sales. At a total company level, headcount grew 22 percent year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly 6 points from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and Q4, respectively. Operating income increased 6 percent and 15 percent in constant currency. And operating margins decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year to 43 percent. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined roughly 4 points year-over-year driven by sales mix shift to cloud, unfavorable FX impact, Nuance, and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.5 billion and grew 9 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations with better-than-expected results in Office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 7 percent and 13 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 11 percent and 17 percent in constant currency, slightly better than expected with the strong renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from E5. Demand for security, compliance, and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14 percent year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings – although we saw continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office consumer revenue grew 7 percent and 11 percent in constant currency driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 13 percent to 61.3 million. Dynamics revenue grew 15 percent and 22 percent in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24 percent and 32 percent in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17 percent and 21 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected growth in Talent Solutions partially offset by weakness in Marketing Solutions from the advertising trends noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11 percent and 18 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage decreased slightly driven by sales mix shift to cloud offerings. Operating expense increased 13 percent and 16 percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 10 percent and 19 percent in constant currency, including 4 points due to the latest change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22 percent and 28 percent in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 35 percent and 42 percent in constant currency, about a point lower than expected – driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth, as we help customers optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 18 percent to over 232 million seats with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat and increased 4 percent in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations – driven by hybrid demand including better-than-expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5 percent and 10 percent in constant currency, driven by Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20 percent and 26 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 3 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure and higher energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25 percent and 28 percent in constant currency, including roughly 8 points of impact from Nuance, and operating income grew 17 percent and 25 percent in constant currency, with roughly 9 points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue decreased slightly year-over-year to $13.3 billion, and grew 3 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations overall, but with OEM and Surface weakness offset by upside in Gaming consoles. Windows OEM revenue decreased 15 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 deferral last year, revenue declined 20 percent driven by PC market demand deterioration noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2 percent and 8 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by the impact of a large HoloLens deal, partially offset by low double-digit declines in consumer Surface sales. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 8 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier. Search and news advertising revenue ex-TAC, increased 16 percent and 21 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefitting from an increase in search volumes and roughly 5 points of impact from Xandr even as we saw increased ad market headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter. And in Gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by better-than-expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue grew 13 percent and 19 percent in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 3 percent and increased 1 percent in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party content as well as in third-party content, where we had lower engagement hours and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars declined 9 percent and 4 percent in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 5 points year- over-year driven by sales mix shift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2 percent and 5 percent in constant currency, driven by the Xandr acquisition, and operating income decreased 15 percent and 9 percent in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.6 billion and cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2 billion, down 5 percent year-over-year driven by strong cloud billings and collections which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 FY22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10 percent year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations grew 2 percent and free cash flow was relatively unchanged year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $54 million driven by interest income which was mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 19 percent. And finally, we returned $9.7 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving to our Q2 outlook, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 7 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes, 6 points in Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. Our outlook has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into Q2. In our consumer business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue and impact both Windows OEM and Surface device results even as the Windows installed base and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and Search and news advertising revenue. In our commercial business demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with consistent execution should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a moderately growing expiry base, against a strong prior year comparable which included a significant volume of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 2 points driven by lower Azure margin primarily due to higher energy costs, revenue mix shift to Azure, and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 11 and 13 percent in constant currency or $16.6 to $16.9 billion US dollars. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid-single digits, as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring resulting in mid-to- high-single-digits revenue growth or low to mid-teens growth in constant currency. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low-double-digits or the low 20s in constant currency driven by continued share gains in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 22 and 24 percent in constant currency or $21.25 to $21.55 billion US dollars. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 5 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption with some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits as demand for our hybrid solutions including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch, will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single digits driven by Enterprise Support. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue of $14.5 to $14.9 billion US dollars. In Windows OEM we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-30s reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable, particularly in the commercial segment. In Devices, revenue should decline approximately 30 percent, again roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits in constant currency. Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow in the low-to-mid teens, roughly 6 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid teens against a strong prior year comparable that included several first-party title launches, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-to-mid-teens. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 6 and 7 percent in constant currency or to be between $17.4 and $17.6 billion US dollars and operating expense to grow between 17 and 18 percent in constant currency or to be between $14.3 and $14.4 billion US dollars. As we continue to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million as interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX and equity movements thru Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be between 19 and 20 percent. And finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow, we expect to make a 2.4-billion-dollar cash tax payment related to the capitalization of R&D provision enacted in the 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. Now some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we now expect a roughly 5-point headwind to full year revenue growth. And FX should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around 20 percent constant currency growth in our commercial business driven by strong demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the increased declines we now see in the PC market. With the high margins in our Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, with our first quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy costs, we now expect operating margins in US dollars to be down roughly a point year-over-year. On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact from the latest accounting change, we continue to expect FY23 operating margins to be roughly flat year-over-year. In closing, in this environment it is more critical than ever to continue to invest in our strategic growth markets such as Cloud, security, Teams, Dynamics 365, and LinkedIn where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally, and you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially thru the year while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount investments we’ve made over the last year. With that, let’s go to Q&A Brett? BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please ask only one question. Jessi, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys for taking the question, and impressive results in what is obviously a very difficult environment. A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point, but I think this is what’s on a lot of investors’ minds, is this is two quarters in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below your guidance. And I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering about is there an inherent volatility in that business that’s just harder to forecast? And on a go-forward basis, how should we think about that forecast? Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure growth, like the glide path for the full year? If you could address those, I think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith, and I do appreciate you asking about that one point, because I do know it is a point of focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility to that number. A point here or there, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point better, and you’ve heard me say it when we’ve been a point worse. And I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with growth across all geos. That was, to the question, generally in line with where we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And as we went through the quarter and as, of course, the macroeconomic environment got more complicated, we continued to focus on that, because ultimately, those optimizations bring value even as budgets are still growing and budgeted spend is still growing. And so, it’s this nuance of you’re still seeing digitization. This is still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you can then make room for new workload growth. We saw that across all segments. If there was one segment where I may have seen it a bit more, I would say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused on. But if you step back and say, this is how you drive ultimate share gains, and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be the focus of our teams inside the company, and also the partners that we rely on to help customers do that as well. And so, as I look forward, there is some inherent volatility to this number. And here, I think you will hear us talk about continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it’s in customer success, whether it’s in optimizations, whether it’s, frankly, in engineering to help people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. I do think that will remain top of mind for us, even as this remains probably the most exciting opportunity and TAM across infra, data and AI that exist in tech and technology. I don’t know, Satya, if you – SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I think that that’s the only thing I would add, Amy, to your point, is that obviously, our investment profile here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good growth rates with the kind of volatility you’re seeing. So, we’re going to stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize for long-term customer loyalty by proactively helping them optimize this spend, which I think is the right thing for us to be doing, as a company on behalf of our shareholders, long term. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Outstanding. Thank you, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you. I’d like to follow up on the last question on Azure specifically. So next quarter, you’re guiding to sequential, further slowing in the business. Is that the factor of optimization? Is it something else that’s going on in here? How should we think about that, that specific component of the guidance, given the fact that you’ve got good bookings, strong RPO grow, etcetera? AMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark. You’re right and let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter, as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number that you’re referring to, we had good what we would call long dated growth, which means we’re having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the platform. And that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to invest here remain intact. And so, it’s about both the optimization that you’re talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes new workflows starting. And those also may not be matched up, one to one, to see sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility. The other piece of it, Mark, that we didn’t talk on before because I was really focused on consumption, is that there per-user headwinds as well, right, because we’re getting, seeing some of these laws of large numbers, in terms of the per-seat business. So, there’s a couple of things going on here, Mark, against, as you said, a very large base. It’s not just the optimization to new workloads. It’s also some per-user work as well. MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, last quarter you called out for the first time SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many are questioning, did that get worse this quarter? And did you see it filter now into the enterprise? Can you talk about what you’re seeing higher up above SMB? AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about Microsoft 365. I think that’s a place where we can talk specifically about the SMB market, because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different than what we saw, frankly, in Q4. In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good renewal execution. And it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in Microsoft. 365. We had on-time renewals that were, frankly, better in Q1, based on expirations, than we’d seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting done on time but getting done within a discount range that we feel good about, that’s consistent. And we saw good upsell to E5. So if you think about that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that’s a good summary. Where we in fact saw – I think we talked about it – new deal moderation, I’d referred to that, frankly, in Q4 as well, it tended to be in, to your point, the smaller end of the market, small-to-midsize companies, and it also tended to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit and I’d refer to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some new value that we’ve put into E3. This is a place where there is some macro impact, but there’s also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4 in terms of security and auto patching for Windows. It’s a great value in the same way E5 is. We land the E5 really well. We’ve got some work to do on landing E3. So, there is some macro. It seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent with what we saw. And there is some execution that I think, frankly, we can get better at as well. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, Thank you very much. Satya, this quarter, we’re seeing an inflection in many of your AI breakthroughs. I’m thinking of GitHub Copilot and the image generation in your designer product. What is it that’s enabling you to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I’m wondering if it’s the OpenAI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities, or something else. And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can kind of dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like 200 million per quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that through this period? SATYA NADELLA: Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI partnership is a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it’s sort of important to call out that we build the supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly differentiated the way compute and the network, in particular, come along, come together in order to support these largescale training of these platform models or foundation models has been very critical. That’s what’s driven, in fact, the progress OpenAI has been making. And of course, we then productize it as part of Azure OpenAI Services. And that’s what we’re seeing both be used by our own first-party applications, whether it’s the GitHub Copilot or designer even inside Edge, and then of course the third party, like Mattel. And so, we’re very excited about it. We have a lot, sort of more to talk about when it comes to GitHub universe. I think you’ll see more advances on GitHub Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of huge investment. The AI moment clearly has arrived and it’s going to be part of every product, whether it’s – in fact, you mentioned our Power Platform, because that’s another area where we’re innovating in terms of incorporating all of these AI models. Yeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have differentiated capability at an infrastructure layer for training and inference. And the model themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models. AMY HOOD: And to your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a little bit of help there. We did not see as big of that. As I said, it’s over 800 for the year. Some of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2 through 4. And I think if you want to think about it as somewhere, 250-ish a quarter. It’s not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the remainder of the year. MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, I’ve love to just ask you around margins. Clearly, you’re experiencing a little bit more sales mix, given the weakness on the Windows side. It looks like you’ve elected not to throttle back OpEx to enable you to meet the three-months-ago guidance for flat margins, so they’ll now drift a little bit lower. Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back OpEx as a counter to that Windows pressure? AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl, and I shared a little bit on the call, but let me share a little more because I think it’s important in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we’re seeing substantial opportunity and growth. The PC market is cyclical, and we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic. And we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple of years, and it fell to the bottom line. And you saw substantially increased margins over that time period. And we did that intentionally because it is a cyclical market. And so, in the same way I see it now, is that PCs are going to be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the Windows app install base, our ability to grow usage, it’s still higher than it was. And that’s a good opportunity for us. And so, in the same way that we let it fall to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it’s important to stay consistent in this down market, because when you have a type of opportunity that we have specifically in the commercial business and the TAMs that Satya talked about as being some of our most exciting, and you have the opportunity with your customers to gain share, to gain confidence, right? And I think it’s important to have a steady hand. Now, let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to the macro environment around cost. As I commented, our sequential headcount growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It’ll be about investing where we said we would invest, which is in focused areas. It’s about moving headcount to make sure, inside the company, we’ve got it on the highest and most important things. We’ve added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months, and we want to make sure we use those headcount in the most productive way possible. And we’re going to do that. And also, we’re going to, frankly, lap some investments that we’ve made at the end of H2, Karl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3. We closed Xander in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we’ll see productivity improvements from the headcount we have and our focus. And so, it’s the ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we’re responding to the macro. It’s possible to do both those things, and I think that’s what we’re doing. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Got it. Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Oh, wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask a question about Office Commercial. A lot of the growth here is driven by subscriber growth, this quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber growth of 14. Could you remind us where the incremental subscribers coming from? Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially over time? I think you’re already over 300 million subscribers, so just any color on just the runway from here. Where is the incremental coming from? And with all the work that you’re doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security analytics, might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber growth over time? Thank you so much. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brad. It’s a good question because you’ve continued to see the seat growth, I think, for actually much longer than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some ways, because we’re focusing on frontline workers scenarios. We’re continuing to focus on small and midsize business growth, and we’re adding new things to which you can grow, whether that’s Viva, whether it’s Teams. There’s new things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value, and then to add seats. And so, I don’t want to say it has to be, again, this vision of “or.” So, I think you’ll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what we’ve been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5 and the E3 SKU, where we’ve added some value, making sure we can still move people to that suite as well. And so, you will see, right, over time, long term, the seat growth move a little bit, and then you’ll see ASP show up. And it depends a little bit on mix, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more RPU in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some E3 execution in Q1. But I actually think there’s room to do both those things, and I’ve felt that way now for a couple of years. BRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Great to hear. Thanks, Amy. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) GREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Okay, thank you. Satya or Amy, as a follow up on Azure, I’m curious how you foresee the magnitude of two different variables on cloud computing demand over that near to medium term, the first being economic pressures on the willingness of some customers to spend, and the second being the impact of the spiking energy cost perhaps as a facilitator for some to do more in the cloud. Do you see these as largely offsetting factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent than the latter? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, the way we see it is overall macro will mean that everybody’s going to optimize their build. In fact, as Amy said, our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer success teams are lined up with them helping customers, quote/unquote, do more with less. So, that’s sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective, the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is to move to the cloud. So, we see the value prop of the cloud. The big winner in all of this will be public cloud, because public cloud helps businesses offset the risk of taking demand risk. The other side, as you described it, is the risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so, that’s another one. The best way to hedge against taking energy cost and be, in fact, more energy efficient is to move to the cloud. That’s where I think a little bit of, as you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say, this is a period where cloud’s going to gain share, because we’re still in the early innings of adoption. And so, we just want to invest going into it with that mindset and build long-term customer loyalty. GREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Very helpful. Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Gregg. Jessi, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) BRENT BRACELIN, Piper Sandler: Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question here. Helpful color on cloud. I wanted to pivot to advertising. This was a segment that crossed over $10 billion, I think, earlier this year; Netflix rolling out ad-supported model next year, powered by Microsoft. What is the broader Microsoft advertising ambitions maybe three-to-five years here, given these are very large and very profitable segments that Microsoft has not historically focused on? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: No, thanks for the question. Our core advertising business has got two elements to it. One is, I’ll call it LinkedIn B2B advertising, where we clearly have a leadership position around both reach, quality of our ROI, and we’ll continue. Of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn engagement continues to grow. And that is that market comes back. Our premium position with LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel very well positioned and we’ll continue to invest in that space. The second one is the place where we are, again very, very focused on, first starting with our own owned and operated. So when we talk about the overall active devices of Windows having grown by 20% over the pandemic, one of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to take our own owned-and-operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and Search, whether it’s the feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are share takers in the browser. We are share takers in terms of the engagement of the feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the installed base that’s now structurally changed in terms of grow. And then the third party with Netflix, we’re really excited about that. And we’re going to look to grow at first and make Netflix a successful partner. But we’re going to continue to grow our third-party business on the ad platform. So, those would be the three areas, LinkedIn, our owned-and-operated advertising, both Search and Feed, as well as third-party ad network. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much.

During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements which are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brett. Amid this macroeconomic environment, the Microsoft Cloud surpassed 25 billion dollars in quarterly revenue for the first time, up 28 percent and 33 percent in constant currency. When I talk with customers, it’s clear there is real opportunity to help organizations in every industry use digital technology to overcome today’s challenges and emerge stronger. In this environment, we are focused on three things: First, no company is better positioned than Microsoft to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative, so they can “do more with less.” From infrastructure and data, to business applications and hybrid work, we provide unique, differentiated value to our customers. Second, we will invest to take share and build new businesses in categories where we have long-term structural advantage. Lastly, we will manage through this period with an intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence in our own operations to drive operational leverage. With that, let me highlight our progress, starting with Azure. Organizations in every industry continue to choose our cloud to align their IT investments with demand. We are seeing larger and longer-term commitments and won a record number of 100 million dollar-plus and one billion dollar-plus deals this quarter. We have more datacenter regions than any other provider and will launch 10 regions over the next year. Our new Microsoft Cloud for Sovereignty helps public sector customers meet urgent compliance, security, and privacy requirements. With Azure Arc, we’re meeting customers where they are, enabling companies like GM, Greggs, UBS, and Uniper to run apps across on-prem, edge, or multi-cloud environments. We’re seeing more customers move their mission critical workloads to Azure. American Airlines, for example, chose our cloud to run their key operational workloads, including its data warehouse, and Telstra will move its internal IT workloads to Azure. And we are the platform of choice for SAP apps on the cloud. Leaders in every industry – including Kraft Heinz, Fujitsu, and Unilever – have migrated ERP workloads to Azure. Just last week, we announced a new service to accelerate adoption of Oracle workloads on Azure. We are the only public cloud with simplified direct access to Oracle databases running on Oracle Cloud. Now, to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform, we provide a complete data fabric, spanning operational databases, analytics, and governance, helping customers focus on creating value instead of integrating a fragmented data estate. More than 65 percent of the Fortune 1000 use three or more of our data solutions, and we are growing faster than the market. We’re seeing leaders in every industry, from LaLiga and Lenovo, to Swiss Re and Walgreens, unify their data using our tools. Cosmos DB is the go-to database powering the world’s most demanding, mission-critical workloads, at any scale. Transactions and data volume increased over 100 percent year-over-year for the fourth quarter in a row. When it comes to AI, we are seeing a paradigm shift as the world’s large AI models become powerful platforms themselves. With our Azure OpenAI Service, a diverse set of customers, from HSBC, PwC, and RTL Group, to Shell and Wipro, are applying language models to advanced scenarios like content and code generation. Now, to developer tools. We have the most popular developer tools across any cloud and any platform. Leaders in every industry, from Ahold Delhaize, to KPMG, to Philips are all choosing GitHub to build software. GitHub Copilot is a first-of-its-kind AI pair programmer, which helps developers write better code faster. More than 400,000 people have subscribed since we made it generally available one month ago. And with our expanding portfolio of container services, organizations like H&M can build modern, more resilient cloud native applications. All-up, revenue from Azure Container services increased by triple digits. Now, to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts rapidly drive productivity gains, at a time when it’s never been more important. We now have nearly 25 million monthly active users. And we are innovating to make it even easier for teams of pro and citizen developers to build end-to-end business solutions together. AB InBev, ARM, Equinor, Toyota, Vodafone, and Zurich Insurance have all built centers of excellence to train employees at scale how to use Power Platform. PG&E, for example, expects to save at least 720,000 hours by eliminating redundant and manual processes across employee workflows. Now, to Dynamics 365. We are helping organizations digitize their customer experience, service, finance, and supply chain functions, and we continue to outgrow the market in every category. Our new Microsoft Digital Contact Center Platform brings together Dynamics 365, Microsoft Teams, as well as enterprise AI capabilities from Nuance, to help customers like HP deliver omnichannel customer engagement. And new integrations between Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management and Teams help people collaborate in the flow of work to overcome supply chain disruptions. We’re winning customers as we help organizations address their most pressing challenges. Peet’s Coffee is modernizing its supply chain with our business applications. Carlsberg is standardizing its field service and customer service operations. And Visa switched to Dynamics 365 for both its sales and call center organizations. When it comes to our industry and cross-industry clouds, we are seeing strong adoption as we take a platform-driven approach to help organizations deliver on their digital imperative. For example, the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare – inclusive of Nuance – is becoming the platform of choice for companies across the healthcare value chain looking to drive meaningful clinical and financial outcomes. Whether it’s a provider modernizing care delivery, a health plan transforming the member experience, or a retailer expanding into health services, having a technology partner that is truly dedicated to empowering their success is a significant differentiator for us. Intermountain Healthcare, for example, chose the Cloud for Healthcare, as well as Nuance’s DAX ambient intelligence solution, as the pillar of its new digital strategy. Now, to Microsoft 365 and Teams. In this economic environment, every organization is looking to support employee flexibility and improve productivity. Hybrid work is now just work – and it’s imperative that organizations reconnect and reengage the workforce – at home, in the office, and everywhere in between. To do this, companies need a digital fabric that connects employees, as well as customers and partners, wherever and whenever they work, while reducing cost and complexity. We’re all-in on Teams. Over the past year, we’ve introduced more than 450 capabilities to empower frontline and knowledge workers to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously, as well as remote and in person. Teams is taking share across every category, from collaboration, to chat, to meetings, to calling – and seeing higher usage intensity as companies turn to the platform to accelerate their digital transformation and orchestrate all their business processes in the flow of work. ISVs, from Adobe to Workday, have built deep integrations with Teams. And more than 100,000 companies, including Johnson & Johnson, Lumen Technologies, and Progressive Insurance, have deployed custom line of business apps in Teams. All-up, the number of third-party and LOB apps with active usage increased by 40 percent year-over-year. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across VoIP and PSTN. We now have over 12 million PSTN users, nearly double the number a year ago. And Teams Rooms bridges the gap between people working remotely and those in the office, with innovations like AI-powered cameras. More than 60 percent of the Fortune 500 have chosen Teams Rooms to connect employees across the hybrid workplace. We’re also building a completely new suite with Microsoft Viva, as we create a new employee experience category. This is both a priority for our customers, and an expansive and high-growth TAM for us. 25 percent of the Fortune 500 already use Viva, as organizations increasingly recognize that employee experience and wellbeing are essential to their productivity. We’ve seen broad adoption across segments and industries, from Commonwealth Bank, Fidelity Investments, and Mastercard, to AstraZeneca and Schlumberger. All this innovation is driving revenue growth across Microsoft 365. Asahi, Expedia Group, and Qualcomm all chose our premium offerings to transform how employees work. E5 seats increased more than 60 percent year-over-year. Now, on to Windows. With Windows, we are putting people at the center to help them securely work, connect, and play. Despite a changing market for PCs during the quarter, we continue to see more PCs shipped than pre-pandemic, and are taking share. And we are seeing higher monthly usage of Windows 11 applications, with increased time spent across creative work, collaboration, gaming, media, and writing code, as people rely on the PC for its unique productivity capabilities, rich interactive experiences, and to stay connected. We’re transforming how Windows is experienced and managed with Azure Virtual Desktop and Windows 365. Azure Virtual Desktop monthly active usage increased nearly 60 percent year-over-year. One year in, we’ve seen strong adoption of Windows 365 from organizations in every industry – from Hamburg Commercial Bank and Kyndryl, to The LEGO Group and Schroders – as they use Cloud PCs to rapidly onboard new and temporary employees, and speed M&A integration, while reducing IT costs. Now, to security. As the rate and pace of threats continue to accelerate, security is the top priority for every organization. We provide comprehensive solutions that integrate more than 50 categories, informed by more than 43 trillion signals each day, reducing cost and complexity. We are taking share across all the major categories we serve. All-up, our security revenue increased 40 percent. We are the only cloud provider with protection for the top three cloud platforms, and we’re seeing more and more customers turn to us to protect their multi-cloud, multi-platform infrastructure. Pearson Vue and Vodafone both chose our security stack to protect their digital estate across clouds. We’re going further to help protect organizations. Our new Entra product family includes tools for permissions management, identity governance, and identity verification. And, we now offer managed threat detection and response with Microsoft Security Experts. The world’s largest hedge fund, Bridgewater Associates, for example, will use the service to supplement its own security operations. Now, to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement among our more than 850 million members, a testament to how mission critical the platform is to connect job seekers with jobs, learners with skills, and marketers with buyers. We are seeing job candidates and employers alike prioritizing skills to more efficiently find and source work. More than 40 percent of companies on LinkedIn now rely on skills filters to identify candidates. LinkedIn Talent Solutions surpassed 6 billion in revenue over the past 12 months, up 39 percent year-over-year. And LinkedIn Marketing Solutions surpassed 5 billion dollars in annual revenue for the first time. We are a leader in B2B digital advertising, and we continue to see customers choose us for higher reach and ROI. More broadly, despite the current headwinds in the ad market, we’re expanding our opportunity in advertising as we look toward the long-term. We are creating a new monetization engine for the web, an alternative that offers marketers and publishers more long-term viable ad solutions, and supports consumer privacy and strong data governance. It starts with our own first-party experiences. We’re focused on increasing our share and engagement across Edge, Bing, and our personalized content feed Microsoft Start. Daily content consumption across Start in categories like news, weather, finance, and sports, increased 80 percent since we launched the service one year ago. And Edge continues to gain share as consumers use it to save money with our built-in coupon and price comparison features. Our approach extends to our third-party ad network. We closed our acquisition of Xandr last month and now power one of the world’s largest marketplaces for premium advertising. With Microsoft Advertising, every media and consumer internet company now has a trusted platform for their own ad innovation and monetization. Just two weeks ago, Netflix chose us as its exclusive technology and sales partner for its first ad-supported subscription offering, a validation of the differentiated value we provide to any publisher looking for a flexible partner willing to build and innovate with them. And, with PromoteIQ, we’re providing a platform for retailers like Home Depot, Kohls, and Kroger to build their own digital commerce marketing channels. This quarter, Sephora chose our solutions to help build a new advertising revenue stream while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now, to gaming. We offer the best value in the gaming industry. Our Xbox Game Pass subscription service includes access to hundreds of games, and the Xbox Series S is the most affordable next gen console. We’ve sold more consoles life-to-date than any previous generation of Xbox and have been the market leader in North America for three quarters in a row among next gen consoles. And, with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we’re bringing games to new endpoints. Players can now stream Xbox games on Samsung Smart TVs. And we’ve partnered with Epic Games to make Fortnite available for free via the browser. Over 4 million people have streamed the game to date, including over 1 million who were new to our ecosystem. In closing, we are investing and sharpening our focus to help our customers during this critical moment AND to capture the massive technological shifts underway. Our portfolio of best-of-category products and best-of-suite solutions, along with our durable business models and intense focus on prioritization and executional excellence, make me confident about our opportunity ahead in the coming year. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $51.9 billion, up 12% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.23 and increased 3% and 8% in constant currency. I’d like to start by discussing the impact of the macroeconomic environment on our results this quarter. First, FX. The US dollar strengthened throughout the quarter creating an additional headwind beyond what we shared mid-quarter. As a result, for the full quarter, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $595 million and $0.04 cents per share beyond our expectations shared in April. Next, extended production shutdowns in China that continued through May and a deteriorating PC market in June contributed to a negative Windows OEM revenue impact of more than $300 million. And finally, reductions in advertising spend impacted LinkedIn Marketing Solutions and Search and news advertising by more than $100 million. In our consumer business, despite those macro challenges, we drove another quarter of share gains for Windows in the PC market and for Edge in browsers. In our commercial business, Q4 was the largest quarter ever for long-term commitments to our platform, and, as you heard from Satya, we saw share gains in areas such as Data and AI, Dynamics, Teams, and Security. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 25% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Our record commitment quarter was driven by increases in the number of 100-million-dollar-plus Azure and 10-million-dollar-plus Microsoft 365 contracts, as well as consistent strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 34% and 37% in constant currency to $189 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 28% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 39% year-over-year. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $25 billion and grew 28% and 33% in constant currency. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 69%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Now back to the total company level. As noted earlier, FX decreased total company revenue by 4 points, 2 points unfavorable to expectations. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 10% and 15% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, gross margin percentage increased slightly as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier was partially offset by sales mix shift to cloud. Operating expense increased 14% and 16% in constant currency driven by increased investments in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, and Nuance. Opex growth included roughly two points from the decision to scale down operations in Russia, employee severance, and the impact from the Xandr acquisition which closed in June. At a total company level, headcount grew 22% year-over-year as we continued to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, LinkedIn, sales and customer deployment, and included roughly 6 points of growth from the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. Operating income increased 8% and 14% in constant currency and operating margins decreased year-over-year to 40%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and FX, operating margins were relatively unchanged as the improvement in cloud services noted earlier and sales mix shift to higher margin businesses were offset by the impact of the Nuance acquisition. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $16.6 billion and grew 13% and 17% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $159 million more than expected. When adjusting for the additional FX headwind, overall segment results were in line with expectations. Office commercial revenue grew 9% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 15% and 19% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year, driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings although growth was impacted by some moderation in new deal volume outside of E5, particularly in the small and medium business customer segment. Demand for security, compliance, and voice value in Microsoft 365, drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 12% of our Office 365 commercial installed base. Office commercial licensing was down 32% and 28% in constant currency, lower than expected driven primarily by a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 9% and 12% in constant currency, in line with expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 15% to 59.7 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19% and 24% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 31% and 36% in constant currency, slightly below expectations due to lower-than-expected growth in new business even as our cloud growth continues to outpace the market. LinkedIn revenue increased 26% and 29% in constant currency, lower than expected as Marketing Solutions was impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier and Talent Solutions was impacted by weaker online job posts late in the quarter. Segment gross margin dollars increased 12% and 17% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 12% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 12% and 19% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $20.9 billion, increasing 20% and 25% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $309 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were in line with expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22% and 26% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 40% and 46% in constant currency, about a point lower than expected driven by a slight moderation in Azure consumption growth across customer segments. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 21% to over 230 million seats with some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. In our on-premises server business, revenue decreased 2% and increased 1% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by a greater-than-expected number of contracts with higher in period revenue recognition. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 8% in constant currency, lower than expected driven by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 3 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage declined roughly 2 points driven by sales mix shift to Azure partially offset by improvements in Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 20% and 22% in constant currency, including roughly 7 points of impact from Nuance, and operating income grew 11% and 18% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.4 billion, increasing 2% and 5% in constant currency. FX decreased segment revenue $127 million more than expected. Excluding the additional FX headwind, segment results were below our guidance range driven by the PC and ad trends mentioned earlier. Windows OEM revenue decreased 2% year-over-year. Despite the deteriorating PC market, we saw share gains again this quarter and volumes remained above pre-pandemic levels. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 6% and 12% in constant currency, lower than expected due to some impact from the small and medium business deal moderation noted earlier. Surface revenue grew 10% and 15% in constant currency driven by commercial sales. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC, increased 18% and 21% in constant currency, lower than expected driven by the slowdown in advertising spend noted earlier, partially offset by the inclusion of three weeks of results from Xandr. And in Gaming, revenue declined 7% and 5% in constant currency, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue declined 11% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined 6% and 4% in constant currency, driven by lower engagement hours and monetization in third-party and first-party content, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions. Segment gross margin dollars were relatively unchanged and increased 4% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year driven by increased usage of Windows Commercial cloud services. Operating expenses increased 8% and 10% in constant currency and operating income decreased 5% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $8.7 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $6.9 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.6 billion, increasing 8% driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.8 billion, up 9% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $47 million primarily driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, resulting in a negative three-point impact on EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 18%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders, up 19% year-over-year through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $46 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, moving to our outlook. My commentary, for both the full year and next quarter, does not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. Let me start with some full year commentary for FY23. First, effective at the start of FY23 we are extending the depreciable useful life for server and network equipment assets in our cloud infrastructure from four to six years, which will apply to the asset balances on our balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, as well as future asset purchases. Investments in our software that increased efficiencies in how we operate our server and network equipment, as well as advances in technology, have resulted in lives extending beyond historical accounting useful lives. This change only impacts the timing of depreciation expense in the future for these assets. As a result, based on the outstanding balances as of June 30, we expect fiscal year 23 operating income to be favorably impacted by approximately $3.7 billion for the full fiscal year and approximately $1.1 billion in the first quarter. This has been included in the guidance we will provide on today’s call. Additional details on the mechanics of the change are in our earnings materials. Second, on FX. Assuming current rates remain stable, we expect a roughly 4-point impact to full-year revenue growth, with headwinds in H1 greater than in H2. FX should also decrease COGS and operating expense growth by 2 points. Now to our full year business outlook based on the current macro environment. At every level of the company, we manage performance on a constant currency basis as we have for many years. Therefore, with the FX volatility we have seen, I will comment on full year in constant currency and in US dollars. We continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating income growth in both constant currency and US dollars. Revenue growth will be driven by continued momentum in our commercial business and a focus on share gains across our portfolio. Operating expense growth will be significant early in FY23 and will moderate materially over the course of the year as we slow the rate of hiring to focus on key growth areas, increase the productivity of prior year headcount investments, and anniversary the Nuance and Xandr acquisitions. And, even with this significant level of investment in our future, we expect operating margins based on constant currency to be approximately flat year-over-year in FY23, excluding the benefit from the latest change in useful life. And in US dollars, we expect FY23 full year margins to be roughly flat as the useful life benefit is mostly offset by the FX headwind mentioned earlier. And finally, we expect our FY23 effective tax rate to be roughly 19%. Now, to the outlook for the first quarter, which unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 5 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 3 points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 6 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 3 points in More Personal Computing. Overall, our outlook has the trends we saw in June continue thru Q1. Continued weakness in the PC market demand and advertising spend will impact Windows OEM, Surface, LinkedIn, and Search and news advertising revenue. Our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio, and consistent execution across the Microsoft Cloud should drive another strong quarter of revenue and share growth although we expect to continue to see growth moderation in our small and medium sized business segment. In commercial bookings, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth on a flat expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly 2 points year-over-year driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted earlier. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q1 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly 1 point driven by revenue mix shift to Azure and the impact from the Nuance acquisition partially offset by continued margin improvement in Azure. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential decrease on a dollar basis with normal quarterly spend variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or $15.95 to $16.25 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly two points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on US dollar growth than at the segment level. In our on-premises business, on a prior year comparable which benefited from contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high 30s. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the low to mid-single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform although results will be impacted by the slowdown in advertising spend and hiring resulting in low to mid-teens revenue growth. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high teens driven by share growth in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue to grow between 25% and 27% in constant currency or $20.3 to $20.6 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 3 points on a constant currency basis. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in consumption. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, although we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low-single digits driven by strong demand for our hybrid offerings offset by the prior year comparable which included benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low-single digits driven by Enterprise Support partially offset by declines in Microsoft Consulting Services. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue to grow between 1% and 4% in constant currency or $13 to $13.4 billion. In Windows OEM we expect revenue to decline in the high-single digits. Excluding the impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline mid-teens reflecting continued weakness in the PC market. In Surface, revenue should decline in the low single digits. Search and news advertising ex-TAC should grow in the mid-to-high teens, roughly 10 points faster than overall Search and news advertising revenue, driven by growing first party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low-to-mid single digits driven by declines in first party content partially offset by growth in Game Pass subscribers and consoles. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the low-to-mid-single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS to grow between 12% and 14% in constant currency or to be between $14.9 and $15.1 billion and operating expense to grow between 19% and 20% in constant currency or to be between $13.3 and $13.4 billion. Total company headcount is expected to continue to grow with 11 thousand hires expected to start in Q1, primarily in cloud engineering, LinkedIn, customer deployment and commercial sales. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q1 effective tax rate to be approximately 19%. Finally, as a reminder on Q1 cash flow, we will be making $3.2 billion of tax payments related to the TCJA transition tax and the transfer of intangible property completed in Q1 FY22. In closing, we continue to see strong demand for our products and services and increased commitment to our platform as we remain focused on delivering compelling customer value in this dynamic environment resulting in continued share gains. As we manage through this period, we will continue to invest in future growth while maintaining intense focus on operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, let’s go to Q&A, Brett. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Jessi, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent, thank you guys for taking the question, and very impressive results in a very difficult environment that we’re all dealing with, particularly when it comes to those commercial cloud bookings. And that’s where my question lies. You talked about the largest ever number of big deals that you guys were able to sign in Q4. Typically, we think this type of environment makes it harder to sign those big deals. Can you talk to us a little bit about how you got that done? Was the consolidating impact that Microsoft brings to the market, the price performance, maybe the macro, is that actually a benefit for you guys to close these deals in this type of environment, or was it just kind of a typical Q4 end of year kind of budget flush kind of thing for you guys, and it was absent of the environment or not really related to the environment? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. It was a record even for us, even with the context of Q4. So, there’s obviously something going on in the macro environment, which does feel that it does plays to our strengths. There are two things at least I would observe. One is, whether the bookings number or the MACC deals and the size of the MACC deals and the number of them, I think speak to very much what we have been talking about for a long time now, which is as a percentage of GDP, IT spend is going to increase because every business is trying to fortify itself with digital tech to, in some sense, navigate this macro environment. So that, I think, is probably what is reflected in those numbers. And then the second aspect is also what you just referenced, which is we do have every layer of the tech stack, right, whether it’s infra, data, hybrid work, security, even Power Platform. In each one of these, we do have this best-of-suite value, which includes best-of-category products, and that is leading to share gains. So if you want to bet on a window on a long-term basis, where you have that best-of-suite value, and then you’re able to sort of consume it on your terms, I think that that’s effectively what some of those numbers are indicators of. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Outstanding. Thank you, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much, and congratulations on the quarter. I’d like to follow up a little bit on that. With all the concerns about macro recession, everyone’s trying to understand how cloud, and from Microsoft’s case more specifically, IaaS, PaaS operates in a slowdown recession. How do you think about Azure’s resiliency? How do you think about Azure’s exposure to advertising business, consumer Internet and SMB if we do see a real recession? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start, and Amy, feel free to add. I mean, overall, we’re not immune to what’s happening in the macro broadly, right, to Keith’s question and your question Mark. I think I’d say I’d start there, because whether it’s on the demand side with consumers or SMBs, I think Amy in her remarks talked about some of that, even in our results in the quarter. But what’s happening with it in Azure, though, is in some sense, businesses trying to deal with the overall macroeconomic situation and trying to make sure that they can do more with less. For example, moving to the cloud is the best way to shape your spend with demand uncertainty, right, because in fact, if anything, one of the things that we’re seeing is an increased shift towards the cloud, and then of course, optimizing your bill. We are incenting even our own field to ensure that the bills for our customers come down. And that, in fact, even shows up in some of the volatility in our Azure numbers, because that’s one of the big benefits of the public cloud. And that’s why I think, coming out of this macroeconomic crisis, the public cloud will be even a bigger winner, because it does act as that deflationary force. So, that’s sort of what we are seeing in the Azure numbers. We will be exposed to consumer driven businesses and SMBs, but at some level, our strength as a company is much stronger in the core commercial. So, I think that will do fine there. The other one is also people building new applications that are completely new frontier. I mean, there are two numbers that I talked about. One is the triple digit growth in Cosmos DB, and triple digit growth in Container App Services. You take those two things, and you say, what are people doing? People are writing applications at a completely different frontier of efficiency, which is a cloud-native, serverless, container-based types of applications. And so, to me, that’s another way for you to make sure that your IT spend goes a long way in a time like this. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, great to hear the double-digit guidance. I guess many are asking are you embedding a worsening macroenvironment or a similar environment that we’re in to get to that type of growth? AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. As I said, it’s trying to take into account the current macroenvironment. And as I said, I took what we saw in June, applied it as best we thought we could through the course of the fiscal year. And if you think about how the... and if you try to look over the course of the year with some of my comments, you’d say, okay, in H1 vs. H2, I would point out three things that changed a bit over the course of that time. First, of course, if we’re talking about USD, it would be FX. It’s a bigger headwind in H1; it’s less of a headwind in H2. The second thing I would point to would be OpEx. As we’ve talked about in H1, we’ve obviously added .2% headcount this quarter. We still have 11,000 hires that we have started in Q1. We’ve still got Nuance and Xandr in acquisitions, and we anniversary, a lot of that as we focus our hiring and focus on the productivity of all the hiring we’ve done over the past year, and then the OEM comparables obviously get a lot different when you get from H1 into H2. And so, as you’re trying to think about the shape, and how did I consider it, I sort of took those things into account, thought about the trends we’ve been seeing in June and applied them as best we can. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks very much. I’d love to probe a little bit more on Azure. Amy, you and Satya talked about a very robust, large new deal activity. I thought your guidance for Azure constant currency growth in the September quarter of a 3-point decel to 43 is fairly solid. But you did mention that in the June quarter, you experienced a little bit of consumption softness. Do you mind explaining what that was and when you put all this together, how you’re feeling about the Azure business in the next couple of quarters in terms of the slope of the likely deceleration? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. Maybe I’ll start and then, Satya, you obviously should add on to the commentary. I would point you, Karl, really to some of the things Satya mentioned and we said in our comments. We did see some deceleration, a point a little more than we had expected in the consumption side. Through the course of Q4, it really applied across all customer segments and in general, applied across geographies. We saw customers, as Satya discussed, much like they always do, focused on optimization and continuing to think about which new workloads to prioritize and start. We’ve really taken that frame and applied it as we thought to H1, and specifically to Q1 in that guidance. It does assume continued consumption deceleration of 3 points, quarter to quarter. I still feel very good about the patterns we’re seeing. I feel good about the workloads that Satya mentioned and where we feel like we can take some share, but at the same time, we really are focused on taking the agreements that we signed in Q4, making sure we’re working with the customers on deployment, projects that have quick time to value, investing to make sure they’re starting the projects that can save them money, that can help them innovate. And I think that’s probably our larger focus rather than just the pure consumption number. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Along those lines on the customers kind of having slightly different spending priorities as they kind of try to maneuver this environment, can you talk a little bit more about what you’re seeing in Office, because obviously, Office E5, you’re offering a much more comprehensive solution that is kind of getting very, very competitive on several aspects? What are you seeing there in terms of your willingness of customers to kind of use this time to kind of consolidate further? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll just start, and Amy, you can add. I mean, the two numbers that are user growth numbers, right, the 14% growth in the number of seats of Microsoft 365, and then the E5 growth of 60%, I think speak to, again, that best-of-suite value in the core and in E5. So, we’re very competitive on both of those and that’s what you’re seeing in that seat growth. AMY HOOD: And I think what I would point to, maybe, just to add a little bit, as you can see, I do think we’ve been building momentum, really, with E5. There’s so much value, and we’ve added and continued to add value to the E5 suite. And as that value has become more and more competitive, both at the category level and at the suite level, we’re very focused on making sure customers get every bit of value in that SKU, so focused on deployment, increasing usage, moving resources there. Some of our investment that we’ve spent over the past six months and looking forward for hiring will be in those areas to make sure we are helping customers get the most out of that SKU. In the team and in Q4, and specifically in some of the bookings numbers, E5 was a strong point in terms of both renewals and people adding E5 to their existing contract. RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Makes sense. Thank you. Congrats. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) PHIL WINSLOW, Credit Suisse: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the strong quarter. Amy, I just wanted to focus in on your comments about capital spending, but also just utilization within Azure and obviously, some of the supply chain issues as mentioned before. What is the sense of sort of where utilization stands for around Azure and as you think about sort of demand trends relative to supply chain. How are you feeling about sort of where capacity stands right now? And is this actually driving any changes in your customer behavior, whether it be increased focus on reserved instances, etcetera? That’d be great, thank you. AMY HOOD: Thank you. Maybe let me start by talking about Q4’s capital spend. Obviously, the big driver of our growth this quarter was in datacenter spend, both new builds as well as adding capacity to existing datacenters. We are seeing, obviously, good demand signal. So hence, we’ve guided to another strong spending quarter in Q1 in terms of capital. Though it’s a sequential decline, I would think about that more as being timing. It always can move around a little bit, just based on when builds are complete or when shipments come in. We do feel that we’ve gotten in a good place on capacity on a global basis and are focused on making sure our customers can drive the new units they need, the new usage they need in those datacenters. I don’t know, Satya, if you wanted to add on anything to that. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, I think that you’ve captured it right, and it is also right that customers are using more reserved instances. And so, that’s essentially a price discount, right? That’s the kind of optimization that you see. So, we are growing. The growth numbers we are posting in consumption is with all that optimization in place. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Phil. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KIRK MATERNE, Evercore ISI: Hi, thanks very much for taking the question. Amy, you noted a couple times just seeing some weakness in more the small business segment. Can you just talk about what’s going on there? Is that an opportunity for you all to go in and try to sell or more bundles and your suite? I guess how much of a drag has that been and do you see it getting better or worse? So just if you could just add a little bit more color on that part of your business, it’d be helpful. Thank you. AMY HOOD: That’s a great question, Kirk. I did allude to it a couple of times when discussing Office EMS or the Azure per-user service as well as Windows Commercial. And, of course, that is because it’s all related to selling Microsoft 365. And we did see, as I noted, some weakness in new deals, particularly in the SMB segments outside of E5. To your point, think of them as SKUs it really intended, right, for that type of audience and customer base. And it came from a couple of things, Kirk, one of which we talked about before, is that that is primarily sold through partner. And so, we need to make sure we’ve got the best value props. We’ve got to make sure the price is right, offers right, and make sure that we are tuning that value prop to what small business customers need today, which is great value. And so, we’ll keep executing that through partner. We’re in the middle of that transition we talked about last quarter, and we’re still working on it. The second thing is I would also say that is a spot where you tend to see macro-weakness show itself. And we alluded to that as well in my comment, because while I can’t tell you in particular which part of that is some of the partner transition work we’re doing versus macro, it certainly feels like both. And so, that’s certainly a spot that we’re watching. I think your point around making sure we’ve got the right lead, which is absolutely do more with less, and that we can help you both modernize and get great value through the suites, but it’s an important caveat to that. But you saw the way it shows itself, as you might notice, is you saw the seat growth be a little lighter than you would have expected in the quarter. And then in Q1, that shows itself as a little bit of decel in that Office 365 growth number quarter to quarter. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kirk. Jessi, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) ALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey, guys, thanks for sneaking me in. I guess I wanted to double-down on the consumption commentary with respect to Azure specifically. I guess, do you feel as though clearly the guidance, I think, has a very confident posture. When you think about your visibility into those consumption dynamics, is it that you’re seeing customers optimize their spend? Are you seeing them commit to longer duration contracts? And therefore, you’ve kind of see the different linearity of that consumption pace? And then if you think about it on a global basis, are there any different patterns domestically versus internationally in those moderating projects starts, or just general optimization conversations? AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start and let Satya add. When we talked about it, what we saw in June and through the quarter, and then as we’re thinking about Q1, is we have seen that deceleration in consumption apply really across customer segments. And in general, it was across geos. I wouldn’t point in particular to any specific geo as showing a very different pattern than any other geo. And certainly, we’ve not applied that logic, as we look into Q1. I do think it speaks to what Satya and I have said, which is we see customers continuing to optimize, whether it’s through reserved instance, whether it’s through existing workloads or purchase patterns. And I expect that to continue, which is absolutely what the guide implies. And it implies that these Azure commitments that we signed through the course of the year, because it takes time to convert those large contracts until actual consumption and new project growth as that work gets completed, both at the customer and with our help, you’ll start to see new projects add as the plots to the optimization that occur. So, I would not point to it as being different that we have certainly seen to this point. It’s just a consistent deceleration that we’ve talked about. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Alex. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, all. Thank you. (Operator Direction.) END"

It was a record third quarter, driven by the continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed 23 billion dollars in revenue, up 32 percent year-over-year. Going forward, digital technology will be the key input that powers the world’s economic output. Across the tech stack, we are expanding our opportunity and taking share as we help customers differentiate, build resilience, and do more with less. Now I’ll highlight examples, starting with Azure. We are building a distributed computing fabric – across the cloud and the edge – to help every organization build, run, and manage mission-critical workloads anywhere. This quarter, we helped more new customers than ever simplify and accelerate their cloud migrations. And it's still early days. We are winning Tier 1 infrastructure workloads. Leaders in every industry –from Blackrock, to Bridgestone, to Lufthansa – are all moving mission-critical workloads to Azure. And we are the market leader for customers’ SAP workloads in the cloud. Atos, Chevron, Fujitsu, and Woolworths all migrated their SAP applications to Azure in recent months. Overall, we are seeing larger, more strategic Azure commitments, from industry leaders, including Boeing, Kraft Heinz, US Bank, and Westpac, who all chose our cloud to accelerate their digital transformations. The number of 100 million dollar-plus Azure deals more than doubled year-over-year. And we’re seeing consumption growth across every industry, customer segment, and geography. Now, to data and AI. Our data stack is unique in bringing best in class operational databases, analytics, and governance into one integrated data fabric., Cosmos DB transactions and data volume increased over 100 percent year-over-year for the third quarter in a row. Synapse data volume more than doubled year over year. And we’re seeing strong adoption of Purview, as we help organizations govern, protect, and manage their data estate across platforms and clouds. From Deutsche Boerse to EY, customers in every industry are using our end-to-end data platform. In AI, we continue to see strong usage of Azure Machine Learning. The number of monthly inference requests increased 86 percent year over year, with companies like PepsiCo using the service to predict which products are most likely to sell. And our Azure Open AI Service brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure, helping companies like CarMax turn customer reviews into customized content for shoppers. Now, to developer tools. From Azure DevOps and GitHub, to Visual Studio, we have the most comprehensive and loved developer SaaS service. Increasingly, every new developer project starts with our tools. Visual Studio has more than 31 million monthly active users, including most of the Fortune 500. And GitHub usage is increasing among both independent developers and startups, as well as the world's most established enterprises. 90 percent of the Fortune 100 use GitHub. In fact, Mercedes Benz, for example, is using GitHub Enterprise to provide a unified development platform for more than 20,000 employees to build, ship, and maintain software. Now, on to Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in every industry. Power Platform surpassed two billion dollars in revenue over the past twelve months, up 72 percent year-over-year, making it one of our fastest growing businesses, at scale. Power Apps is the market leader in low code/no code app development, and Power BI has more than 200,000 customers. And our acquisition of MINE-it adds new process mining capabilities, helping organizations identify bottlenecks and opportunities for operational efficiency. Now, to Dynamics 365. Dynamics 365 is growing faster than the business applications market overall. For example, in a world of supply chain constraints, we’re helping companies like Cracker Barrel and Unilever predict disruptions before they happen. Businesses like Heineken and Siemens are turning to Dynamics 365 to drive and deliver more consistent and personalized customer engagement and service. We’re leading innovation in the new industrial metaverse to help companies optimize their operations using technologies such as IOT, Digital Twins, Connected Spaces, and Mixed Reality applications And we’re further differentiating the Microsoft Cloud by bringing together Dynamics 365, Teams, and Synapse to usher in a new era of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. When it comes to industry, our six industry clouds, are helping customers speed time to value. Our Cloud for Healthcare was front and center at HIMSS last month, where we introduced Azure Health Data Services to unify disparate clinical, imaging, and medtech data. Cleveland Clinic will use the solution to normalize data from different systems and integrate insights into the clinician workflow. And with our acquisition of Nuance, I’m excited about our opportunity to apply the company’s deep enterprise AI expertise to accelerate the growth of both Nuance’s business, and our industry clouds. Now, on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement, as more than 830 million professionals used the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. Amid the Great Reshuffle, we’re seeing a skills-first labor market emerge. The number of companies using skills filters on LinkedIn to fill open roles has doubled year-over-year. In this dynamic labor market, hires on LinkedIn increased 88 percent. Talent Solutions revenue was up 43 percent, marking the sixth consecutive quarter of accelerating growth. Our Marketing Solutions business continues to thrive as we offer advertisers high reach and ROI. And creators are increasingly turning to the platform to establish their voices and grow their communities, using tools like Newsletters to share content they are passionate about. 28 million members now subscribe to at least one newsletter on LinkedIn, up 51 percent over the past quarter alone. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. The last two years have proven that every organization needs a digital fabric that connects the entire organization, from the boardroom to the frontline, to customers and partners. No company is better positioned to meet this need than Microsoft, with Microsoft 365 and Teams. Teams is the most used and most advanced platform for work, and the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. And organizations – from enterprises to SMBs – are relying on Teams to run their business. Our comprehensive approach reduces complexity and costs. Microsoft 365 customers can save as much as 60 percent, compared to a patchwork of single point identity, productivity, collaboration, and meetings solutions. Teams usage has never been higher. We’re seeing growth in every segment, including very small businesses with Teams Essentials. Teams is the leading platform for collaborative apps. From Asana to Zendesk, there are over 1,000 third party apps available via the Teams app store. And companies in every industry, including CBRE, CVS Health, and the National Health Service in the United Kingdom, have built custom line of business apps within Teams, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. And, we’re adding new growth engines to meet the demands of hybrid work, with Teams Rooms, Teams Phone, and Microsoft Viva. Teams Rooms is bridging the gap between people working remotely and those in the office, with innovations like Front Row. Teams Phone with Operator Connect enables organizations to easily bring their existing calling service to Teams. Total Operator Connect minutes increased 8X quarter over quarter. And Viva has more than 10 million monthly active users at companies like Blum, Cerner, and Marks & Spencer. This quarter, we added LinkedIn’s Glint employee engagement tool to Viva, ensuring leaders can more easily solicit employee feedback and receive actionable insights. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. Organizations across the private and public sector, including American Family Insurance, the Queensland Government, and Telefonica, are increasingly choosing our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. The PC has never been more relevant to work, life, and play. The number of use cases is increasing, as is the amount of time spent on PCs. More than 100 million PCs have shipped in each of the last eight quarters, and Windows continues to take share. With Windows 11, we continue to see the highest quality scores of any version of the operating system. And enterprises are adopting Windows 11 at a faster pace than previous releases. With Windows 365, we’re bringing the power of Azure computing to Windows computers, enabling businesses like Lands’ End, SES, and Xerox to stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. New integrations between Windows 11 and Windows 365 will make it possible to switch between a Cloud PC and a local PC with a single click. And we continue to help organizations like AIG, Grant Thornton, and Sage shift their on-premises virtualization services to the cloud with Azure Virtual Desktop. In consumer, Windows is key to curating our content and services to help every person with their everyday tasks, from browsing and searching, to learning, gaming, and shopping – all with security and privacy built-in. We are seeing strong engagement, with nearly 500 million monthly active users of our personalized content feed, Microsoft Start. As usage continues to grow, we are seeing a flywheel emerge between content, consumption, and commerce, as we generate new opportunities for content creators, as well as advertisers. And our browser, Microsoft Edge, continues to gain share as we help people save money and shop securely. Now, to security. Security is a top priority for every organization undergoing a digital transformation. To keep our customers secure, we build security by design into every product we sell. And, we deliver end-to-end solutions spanning security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, across clouds and platforms, informed by 24 trillion threat signals each day. This comprehensive capability has been critical during recent world events, and we continue to disrupt cyberattacks and share threat intelligence with the Ukrainian government, as well as other public sector agencies. Multi-cloud, multi-platform support is central to our approach. In security, we are the only cloud provider with native multi-cloud protection for the industry’s top three cloud platforms. In identity, we now provide permissions management across clouds. Azure Active Directory is the undisputed market leader, with more than 550 million monthly active users. In management, the number of Windows, Android, and iOS devices protected by Intune grew over 60 percent year over year. And we’re expanding to new market segments, with Microsoft Defender for Business, which helps keep small businesses secure. This innovation and differentiation is driving our overall growth. All up, the number of customers who trust our security solutions grew nearly 50 percent year over year to 785,000, including Citrix, Domino’s Pizza, Fujitsu, Heineken, and Petronas, who rely on us to protect their multi-cloud infrastructure. And we have over 15,000 partners in our security ecosystem, more than anyone else in the industry. Now, on to gaming. Our ambition is to empower gamers to play when, how, and where they want. With our Xbox Series S and X consoles, we have taken share globally for two quarters in a row and we are the market leader this quarter among next gen consoles in the U.S., Canada, U.K., and Western Europe. And with Xbox Cloud Gaming, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. To date, more than 10 million people have streamed games. Many of our most popular titles, including Flight Simulator, are now accessible on phones, tablets, and low-spec PCs for the first time. Our Game Pass library now includes hundreds of titles across PC and console, including more games from third party publishers than ever before. Billions of hours have been played by subscribers over the past 12 months, up 45 percent. And, with Azure, we are building the best cloud for game of all sizes to build, host, and grow their games. New capabilities speed time to development and to help connect players across platforms. Azure gaming revenue fiscal year to date increased 66 percent. In closing, we are entering a new era where every company will become a digital company. Our portfolio of durable digital businesses and diverse business models, built on a common tech stack, position us well to capture the massive opportunities ahead. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $49.4 billion, up 18% and 21% in constant currency. Earnings per share was 2.22 and increased 14% and 18% in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit from the third quarter of fiscal year 21. Several items impacted our financial performance that were not included in the guidance provided on our January earnings call. First, Nuance. My comments today across Q3 results and Q4 outlook include the impact from the Nuance acquisition which closed on March the 4th. Our results include $111 million in revenue and a negative $0.01 impact to earnings per share, including purchase accounting, integration, and transaction related expenses. Within our results, unless specifically noted otherwise, Nuance was not a material driver of growth rates. We continue to expect the Nuance acquisition will be minimally dilutive in FY22 and accretive in FY23 to non-GAAP EPS. Second, FX. The US dollar strengthened throughout the quarter and created an incremental 1-point FX headwind to total company revenue compared to expectations. As a result, revenue and EPS were negatively impacted by $302 million and $0.03 per share, respectively. Finally, the war in Ukraine. We suspended all new sales of our products and services in Russia. Revenue generated in Russia represents less than 1% of total company revenue and we expect that it will decline significantly. The impact to operating income this quarter was roughly $130 million split evenly between lower revenue and higher bad debt expense, resulting in a negative $0.01 impact to EPS. Our results for the quarter are better than we expected across revenue, operating income, and EPS as we again delivered another strong quarter of top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings together with excellent execution by our sales teams and partners drove increased commitment to our platform as well as higher usage of our services that Satya mentioned earlier. Commercial bookings increased 28% and 35% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. We also saw better-than-expected growth in large, long-term Azure contracts against a very strong prior year comparable. Nuance benefited bookings by roughly 5 points. Our on-premises transactional licensing revenue, across both the Office and Server businesses, was more negatively impacted than expected due to the transition from our Open License program to our Cloud Solution Provider program. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32% and 34% in constant currency to $155 billion with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 96%. Microsoft Cloud revenue was $23.4 billion and grew 32% and 35% in constant currency, again ahead of expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. In our consumer business, as you heard from Satya, we saw market share gains across PCs, gaming consoles, and our Edge browser. Now back to the company level. As noted earlier, the US dollar strengthened throughout the quarter. FX decreased total company revenue by 3 points, 1 point unfavorable to expectations, decreased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and decreased operating expense growth by 2 points, 1 point favorable to expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18% and 21% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 68%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased approximately 1 point driven primarily by improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 15% and 17% in constant currency, slightly lower than expected as investments that shifted to future quarters were partially offset by the inclusion of Nuance. At a total company level, headcount grew 20% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, customer deployment, LinkedIn, and sales, and included approximately 4 points of growth from the addition of Nuance. Operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency and operating margins increased slightly year-over-year to 41%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 2 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.8 billion and grew 17% and 19% in constant currency in line with expectations. Better than expected results across Office 365, LinkedIn, and Office consumer were offset by impacts from incremental FX, the Open Licensing transition, Russia, as well as lower-than-expected results in Dynamics. Office commercial revenue grew 12% and 14% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased 17% and 20% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from continued momentum in E5 revenue. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 16% year-over-year to nearly 345 million, with continued growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. And nearly 45% of our Office 365 commercial seats were purchased through Microsoft 365. Office commercial licensing was lower than expected, down 28% and 25% in constant currency, driven by the factors discussed earlier and a lower mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Office consumer revenue grew 11% and 12% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 16% to 58.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 22% and 25% in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 35% and 38% in constant currency, substantially faster than the market although a bit lower than expected as we focus on stronger execution on our recent investments. LinkedIn revenue increased 34% and 35% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions as well as continued strength in Marketing Solutions and record levels of engagement on the platform. Segment gross margin dollars increased 16% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13% and 14% in constant currency, and operating income increased 19% and 23% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment, which includes approximately 4 weeks of results from Nuance. Revenue was $19.1 billion, increasing 26% and 29% in constant currency. Excluding the impact of Nuance and the approximately $150 million greater FX than expected, revenue results were ahead of expectations. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% and 32% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services revenue grew 46% and 49% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. The inclusion of Nuance cloud services did not change the Azure constant currency growth rate. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 25% to over 218 million seats. In our on-premises server business revenue increased 5% and 7% in constant currency, ahead of expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings partially offset by the Open Licensing transition mentioned earlier. The inclusion of Nuance on premises offerings did not change the server constant currency growth rate. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5% and 6% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services. The inclusion of Nuance professional services impacted the constant currency growth rate by one point. Segment gross margin dollars increased 24% and 27% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point with improvements in Azure partly offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 17% and 19% in constant currency and operating income grew 29% and 33% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.5 billion, increasing 11% and 13% in constant currency, above expectations driven by better-than-expected performance in search and Windows offset by Surface. FX decreased segment revenue approximately $100 million greater than expected. Windows OEM revenue increased 11%, with continued strength in the commercial PC market, which has higher revenue per license. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 14% and 19% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. Surface revenue grew 13% and 18% in constant currency, lower than expected, driven by the consumer channel, partially offset by strength in commercial. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 23% and 25% in constant currency, better than expected, benefiting from an increase in search volumes even as we saw headwinds during March from the impact of the war in Ukraine. And in Gaming, on a high prior year comparable, revenue increased 6% and 8% in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue was better than expected as increased supply of consoles in quarter drove growth of 14% and 16% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue grew 4% and 6% in constant currency, below expectations, driven by lower engagement across the platform, even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 13% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Operating expenses increased 17% and 18% in constant currency and operating income grew 7% and 10% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.3 billion, in line with expectations. Cash paid for P, P, and E was $5.3 billion. Cash flow from operations was $25.4 billion, increasing 14% as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds as we manage continued uncertainty in the supply chain. Free cash flow was $20.0 billion, up 17%. This quarter, other income and expense was negative $174 million, lower than anticipated driven by net losses on investments, including mark-to-market losses on our equity portfolio, and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement. Equity market declines drove net investment losses this quarter compared to net investment gains last year, a negative 2-point impact on year-over-year EPS growth. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $12.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, a few reminders. First, FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total company revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 3 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and 2 points in Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing. Second, my remarks for the next quarter include a full quarter of impact from the Nuance acquisition. Third, we anticipate the war in Ukraine to continue to impact our business in Q4 with a roughly $110 million impact on revenue and minimal impact on operating expenses. Next, we have taken into account the current impact of shutdowns in China in our outlook. However, extended production shutdowns that reach into May would further negatively impact our outlook across Windows OEM, Surface, and Xbox hardware. Finally, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a USD basis. With that context in place, let’s turn to our Q4 outlook. In our largest quarter of the year we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand across our solution portfolio, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, a growing Q4 expiry base, strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, and increased commitment to our platform should drive healthy growth against a strong prior year comparable. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be down roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q4 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 1 point driven by continued improvement across our cloud services partially offset by a revenue mix shift to Azure. Capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $16.65 and $16.9 billion. In Office Commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365 with healthy seat growth across customer segments and ARPU growth thru E5. We expect Office 365 revenue growth to be sequentially lower by a point or two on a constant currency basis. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline similar to last quarter. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single digits, driven by Microsoft 365 subscriptions. For LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the high 20s driven by the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud we expect revenue between $21.1 and $21.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth to be sequentially lower by roughly 2 points on a constant currency basis with a bit more FX impact on US dollar growth than at the segment level. Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth in our consumption business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to-mid single digits as demand for our hybrid offerings will be more than offset by the strong prior year comparable which included 4 points of benefit from contracts with higher in period revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness from the licensing program transition noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.65 and $14.95 billion. As mentioned earlier, our guidance reflects the current constraints from the shutdowns in China which have negatively impacted Q4 supply for OEM, Surface, and Xbox consoles. In Windows OEM we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits driven by the continued shift to a commercial-led PC market where revenue per license is higher. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low-double digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in low double digits. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth of approximately 20%. And in Gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits driven by lower engagement hours year-over-year as well as constrained console supply. We expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline mid-single digits though engagement hours are expected to remain higher than pre-pandemic levels. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $16.6 to $16.8 billion and operating expense of $14.8 to $14.9 billion resulting in another quarter of operating margin expansion excluding the change in useful life. We expect other income and expense to be negative $50 million reflecting FX remeasurement impact based on market conditions in April. Similar to the rest of our guidance, further equity and FX movements thru Q4 are not reflected in this number. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio, which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%. We expect to close FY22, even in a more complex macro environment, with the same consistency we have delivered throughout the year with strong revenue growth, share gains, and improved operating margins as we invest in the areas that are key to sustaining that growth. As we look toward FY23, our track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets gives us confidence that we will drive continued healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Now, Brett, let’s go to Q&A. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request the participants please only ask one question. Jessi, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you guys so much for taking the question, and really impressive results. And what we see is a pretty difficult climate out there, definitely from the stock market perspective. But if we think about interest rates, if we think about inflation – a there’s a conflict going on in Europe right now – it does seem to be a tough backdrop. You guys are operating super well. I mean, the acceleration in Azure at that scale is truly awesome. And if I’m not mistaken, Office 365 Commercial accelerated as well in the quarter, so really impressive results. But I think a question that most investors are going to have is where do you garner the confidence and the durability of this growth, given how volatile this macro-backdrop is? Is it conversations you’re having with customers? Is that what you see in the backlog? Maybe if you give us some kind of insight into what gives you guys the confidence to put out that guide, to put out those healthy comments for FY23, what are you seeing that could really help give us and give investors a little bit more confidence in the durability of this growth in this environment? SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start. Maybe at three levels, Keith. One is just the competitiveness of our tech stack, all up sort of from infrastructure all the way to the SaaS applications when it comes to the commercial cloud, and as well as how we’re able to monetize, for example, the install base of our consumer franchises as well. Both of these places, we feel we are competitive, and increasingly so coming out of the pandemic, to gain share. I would also say that in many of these places, we have price leadership. I mean, take the one point I made, which is if there is any macro-headwind, wherever you have more value for less price means, you win. And in our case, when it comes to our commercial cloud offerings, we have significant advantages on that across the stack. The second thing is, in the conversations we are having with our customers, the interesting thing I find from perhaps even past challenges, whether macro or micro, is no, I don’t hear of businesses looking to their IT budgets or digital transformation projects as the place for cuts. If anything, some of these projects are the way they are going to accelerate the transformation, or for that matter, automation, for example. I have not seen this level of demand for automation technology to improve productivity, because in an inflationary environment, the only deflationary force is software. That’s the second micro thing, that tone thing that’s different. At the end of the day, though, I mean, none of us here are trying to forecast macro. All we think of is the TAMs that we are competing in are large. As a percentage of GDP, tech spend is, on a secular basis by the end of the decade, going to double. We just want to keep driving usage, driving share and be competitive. That’s kind of how we view what we are doing and that’s where our confidence comes from in terms of our outlays, whether it’s OpEx or CapEx. I don’t know, Amy, if you want to add to that? AMY HOOD: I think the only thing, Satya, I might add is I think we’ve always, and I think we’ve used this language quite frequently, focused on the long-term opportunity. You talked about it as the TAM that we’re focused on. I would say also, there’s still a lot of that TAM left to go after and it is quite early still in the transitions you’re talking about, from a digital transformation perspective, from an automation perspective, from type of value and real productivity enhancements that can be made. And so, I think the continuity of the execution has certainly been very good from the sales and partner side. But I would also say, to your point, we’re investing for a long-term opportunity, and our confidence that that long-term outcome is right is, I think, the basis for where you and I are talking, giving this answer from. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Outstanding. Great quarter. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks. Amy, on your guidance, are you changing any of your close rate considerations or adding more supply chain constraints into that, or is this the same guidance methodology that you’ve been giving us in the past? AMY HOOD: I assume we’re specifically talking about most of the guidance in the more personal computing segment where the supply chain constraints, which are specifically related to the production shutdowns in China. I’ve generally followed the same principle I try to follow, which is I give you my best knowledge as of today. I did note, and tried to do that with a lot of clarity, that were the production shutdowns to extend into May, there would be further negative impact on those from a supply constraint position. As you know, in the OEM business, that revenue is recognized at the point of production, and then for Xbox consoles as well as Surface, it’s at sell in. Production delays even earlier in May can obviously have a big impact on the quarter. We’re watching it. I’ve tried to make that transparent in the guidance. Outside of that, my guidance is reasonably consistent with how I like to do it. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Great, thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter and on the strong guidance. I think it’s going to not just help the stock, but hopefully help a little bit more across into the industry. I’d like to look at Office, which had strength probably more than people expected. Where are we in the upsell opportunity from E3 to E5? And can you give us any sense of the sizing of how much of the growth, not just now, but going forward do you think is going to come from frontline users? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Maybe I’ll start answering that question and Satya, if you want to add anything. Very specifically, Mark, I would say this quarter was quite similar in nature to what you saw in the past few. Seat growth, while across all segments, was especially good and frontline worker and SMB. That did mask a little bit, as it often does. The RPU improvement, given those tend to be lower priced SKUs, the RPU improvement that we’re seeing from the transitions in to E5. The transition from E3 to E5 still has opportunity. I would say we’re in the earlier transitions of that. In terms of, as I think about going forward, there’s certainly still room for both seat growth specifically, and frontline worker, as you noted, as well as SMB, and then RPU expansion through the E5 transition. The thing I would add that Satya mentioned in his comments and again in his first answer is really the value that is available to customers in E5, whether that is security, whether it’s compliance, whether it’s phone, whether it’s analytics, the value of that suite. And if you think even more broadly, the value of Microsoft 365, which adds in more components around Windows, I think we are offering high value and that tends to give us some optimism that we can continue to execute well in that segment. I don’t know, Satya, if there’s anything you would add to that. SATYA NADELLA: No, you covered it well, Amy. I mean, I think the fundamentals are pretty strong here still, whether it’s E5 growth, SMB growth, frontline worker. I’d also add emerging markets. I mean, this is the first time, I feel, that we have products that fit just emerging markets, like Teams Essentials, where we can even really penetrate markets that we’ve never sold anything in the past. And then the new growth engines that you talked about, Teams Phones, Teams Rooms, Viva and even Windows 365 are all things that we can, again, drive growth from, and the point about sort of our value is probably very, very strong in a time like this in particular. And we see it. The one thing also I’d say is the usage data that we are seeing is peak everywhere. And so, that’s the other thing, is we definitely will optimize for driving usage and deployment, and that’s going to be our priority. MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Congrats. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Okay, great. Amy, you called out some transactional weakness, which in the March quarter, we can see in the on-prem Office segment. And in your guidance in the server product segment, you suggest we might see it there, too. Is that something that you would characterize as Microsoft specific, as you described in your comments, or transitioning customers off your open license program, or do you feel like that’s a broader issue where maybe we’re starting to see a little bit of a tilt from on-prem to cloud even faster than we’ve seen before? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. It’s a very good question. I would say it does not feel like the tilt from on-prem to cloud felt any different in a way that would have impacted the quarter any more so than it normally does, in terms of the normal transitions that we’ve seen, to your point, on Office or, frankly, even server, as we have people move those workloads and migrating those workloads to the cloud. This really was a very significant – think of it as a where partners transact, and we have such a broad, and valuable and really partner community that is very fast. And we put this and had planned for this change for January 1st, and we executed the change on January 1st as planned. And it’s just taking us a little longer to onboard all of this community to make sure that they can transact the way they want to with the program. I do think it’s going to take us longer than we thought. We’re going to continue to see that impact in Q4. And I know the teams are working hard to make sure that partners get comfortable with the new system, which is important to us. SATYA NADELLA: And the only thing I’d add is that this change is super good for both the partners, the customers and Microsoft, long term. There’s execution ahead, but we want to do this because it benefits everybody. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Got it. Thanks, Satya. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, thank you very much. Satya, a handful of infrastructure software companies have commented that their consumption activity actually started to slow a few months ago. And so, I’m curious, what in your view is allowing your Azure trajectory to show better resilience? And do you, in fact, see some of the newer products kicking in, such as Azure ARC or Synapse Cognitive Services, OpenAI and perhaps contributing to the strength, and health and resiliency of that Azure number? SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, what I’d say, Mark, is that what we’re seeing is a classic what happens with consumption meters, right, which is they grow and then they get optimized and they grow again, both existing and new. And so, it sort of will always have some amount of volatility that even Amy referenced, quarter over quarter. But if I walk up this, one thing that we look at is growth coming from all segments, right? Small business and enterprise, is it coming from all regions? And it is. We also look at the type of workloads it’s coming from. And so, it looks healthy in all of those. And if you walk up the stack, to your point, on the infrastructure side, the tier one workloads is where I think we are seeing some big tier one workloads. And I had many comments on SAP and other workloads moving. The second thing I would say is on the PaaS services and our Dev SaaS, that’s another area where we have differentiated value. We see good growth there. Data and AI for sure. I mean, the thing that I find really to be something that I think, in the long run, is going to probably be one of the bigger drivers of our growth and differentiation is our data fabric, because we are the only guys who have a complete data fabric from the operational store that’s fully integrated into an analytics engine, that’s fully integrated into governance. And that increasingly is going to become more and more important, right? I mean, you can’t be dealing with a new regulation coming on privacy and governance on one end and your operational store being divorced from that. We have a very differentiated offering, and I talked about some of the growth numbers there. The AI inference is also finally kicking in. They are very small today, but even when I look at the total that’s just essentially a compute meter, there’s growth there. Overall, I think we will see, quarter over quarter, some cyclicality depending on which customers. In fact, we pay people at Microsoft to reduce customer bills and which we should. Given that, we may see cyclicality in terms of how optimizations happen, but overall, we’re still very early on as the world sort of migrates to the cloud and uses, essentially, cloud infrastructure and compute as sort of to drive their operational efficiencies and product. MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much. Congrats on a spectacular quarter. Satya, very clearly on your comments, and in particular, you talked about tech as a percentage of GDP doubling over the next seven, eight years or so. Nobody could have really predicted, maybe besides yourself, that Azure would be this big and growing this fast at this point in time, relative to, say, five or six years back. As you look forward, what part of the Microsoft tech stack do you think is underrepresented in the digital world and has therefore more opportunity to gain, as you build out your thesis on tech as a percent of GDP doubling? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, the thing that I always go back, Kash, is that all enterprise value, at least as far as I can tell, gets created at three layers of the tech stack. What happens with infrastructure whenever something can be 10x better? For example, when we talk about the next generation of multi-edge, multi-cloud infrastructure remaining one of the leaders, that’s going to be a massive EV creation as a percentage of GDP tech spend doubled. That’s where everything from Azure, Azure Arc, our database, all of that is super important. The other one is this is sort of the age of AI. In other words, the core business logic is not being written. It’s being written by software. When I look at when I use GitHub Copilot, therein lies the future of what how all business logic gets written. And so, to me, the AI layer, both the training supercomputers as well as the inference layer, that’s a place where you will see us integrate what, today, you all consider to be two different businesses, whether it’s Azure and Windows. They’re just one business to me because to me, where training happens, where inference happens will be written once by developers, and then it’ll light up across this distributed fabric. That’s another place where I think there’s tons of enterprise value that will get created over time. And then, of course, the UI layer always is the biggest one. And the next inflection point, whether it’s what happens with metaverse or what happens with even on the industrial side with IoT and digital twins, those are all things that I think will be the ones that we will be focused on. These three things translated into workloads and what we call our customer solution areas are the ways that, at least, we are investing in. KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Fascinating. Thank you so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Jessi, next question, please. (Operator direction.) MICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: Hey there. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question and great job with the results. Azure growth and commercial booking strength stand out. You mentioned a step down expected in Azure growth in Q4, but you still suggest very impressive growth at that scale. Can you expand on the large deal commentary, the longer-term strategic deals you’ve referenced a few times over the past couple of quarters, how those impact visibility or maybe the approach to framing targets there? And anything you can add just around how the addition of Nuance helps the cloud business and the industry cloud approach, as well. Greatly appreciate it. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Satya, do you want to start with your comments maybe on Nuance overall, and then I can address sort of how the larger long-term. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, sure. Just a couple of quick things. One is on the strategic commitments that are being made, we’re sort of working at them a workload at a time. And so, we feel very, very good about both the type of workloads. In fact, there is a migration of a bunch of workloads that we may have won in the client server and other are migrating. But the most exciting thing is the type of tier one workloads that we have never seen run on any Microsoft infrastructure that’s running on Azure today and being optimized on Azure. That’s the thing that we see as we win these large strategic deals. On Nuance, for me, the thing that’s exciting is Nuance is a platform layer for these AI-driven applications that are getting deployed, whether it’s in healthcare or even in the enterprise contact center. We are very excited about Nuance now being part of the Microsoft family. You will see us pretty aggressively go innovate there and grow the impact of these solutions in both what is sort of the large percentages of our GDP, like healthcare, where I think things like tackling issues like physician burdens with new innovative solutions is much needed. And we are really looking forward to exercising that. AMY HOOD: And Michael, maybe specifically, you’re absolutely right. I tend to mention the impact of large, long-term Azure contracts in the context of commercial bookings and some volatility we often can see in that because of it. But really, I think the way we think about them, maybe outside of this phone call, is that it’s the beginning of the commitment between us and a customer to start to work together to deliver value. And so, we go workload by workload, opportunity by opportunity. And I think that’s what you are inferring a bit, is that it’s almost the top of the funnel to create value for the for the customer. We call it delivering success to make sure they’re spending the dollars the most effective way, making sure we’re tackling the hardest problems that they need solved. And with that comes our investments that we’ve made and deployment resources and usage resources, specifically in Azure to make that possible with customers. And so, you’re right to say I do talk about them in terms of volatility they create. What it creates inside the company is the beginning of a commitment to make sure we’re tackling the workloads and the solutions that the customers want to make happen across all the workloads, frankly, that Satya’s talked about today. MICHAEL TURRIN, Wells Fargo: That’s a great complementary point to also highlight. Thanks very much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Michael. Jessi, we have time for one last question. (Operator direction.) KEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Hi and many thanks. I wanted to break it up into two parts, but I was wondering if you could comment on what you see is the strength of the PC market, as you look out over the course of the calendar year, if you focus on the demand side of the equation, not the supply side of the equation. And really the more important related part is, given the outlook that you may have for the PC market, how are you thinking about the durability of the Windows side of your business? In particular, if you comment on the fundamentals related PC market, but also the opportunities to keep mixing up, so to speak, help by Microsoft 365? Many thanks. AMY HOOD: Satya, why don’t you start and I’ll add on? SATYA NADELLA: Perfect. I think on the commercial side, I think it’s well understood that Windows is the socket for Microsoft 365. We have tremendous value; Amy referenced this earlier. In fact, we just launched Windows 11 and pro value with Windows 356. That’s resonating super well. The customer sat, adoption rates, when it comes, whether it’s security, whether it’s our productivity, we feel good about the commercial business. We’ll stay focused on it, on the commercial side. And on the consumer side, coming out of, again, the pandemic, the intensity of the usage has gone up. One of the areas of focus for us is some of the stuff that I talked about in my remarks, is just the usage, right? When you think about 500 million users engaging with Microsoft Start, that’s not the type of engagement we had. And so, with the large install base, now we have a significant room there. The browser share growth, we have significant room there. And then of course the subscription attaches, whether it’s gaming or whether it’s productivity or suite. That’s kind of how I look at what we are going to do, at least in the immediate future. PC remains a very important category in, I think, people’s lives, is what we’ve discovered during the pandemic. And if anything, the intensity of usage is increased. And there will be cyclical demand that we’ll go through, but the number of use cases has definitely, I think, structurally increased. AMY HOOD: Exactly. I think the one thing I would add on your demand side, we have seen the transition from, I would say, in the middle of a pandemic, definitely a consumer-driven demand cycle. We’ve transitioned that to be a commercial part of the demand side. And so, I do expect that to be the case. Obviously, I think this is the second quarter in a row we’ve seen that transition. Expect Q4 to be even more of that, and then we’ll wait and see how the second half of the year shapes up. KEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Okay. Many thanks. Congratulations. AMY HOOD: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thanks, everyone. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, everyone. (Operator direction.) END "
MSFT,2022,2,2022-01-25T12:00:00-00:00, "Microsoft FY22 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, January 25, 2022 BRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, driven by continued strength of the Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $22 billion in revenue, up 32 percent year over year. We’re living through a generational shift in our economy and society. Digital technology is the most malleable resource at the world’s disposal to overcome constraints and reimagine everyday work and life. We are innovating and expanding our entire portfolio across consumer and commercial segments to help people and organizations thrive in this new era. Now I’ll highlight examples, starting with Azure. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need a distributed computing fabric to build, manage, secure, and deploy applications anywhere. We have more datacenter regions than any other provider, delivering fast access to cloud services, while meeting data residency requirements. We’re extending our infrastructure to the 5G network edge, helping operators and enterprises create new business models and deliver ultra-low latency services closer to the end user. AT&T, for example, is bringing together its 5G network with our cloud services to help General Motors deliver next generation connected vehicle solutions to drivers. Our Azure Arc customer base has tripled year over year. We’re now helping thousands of organizations – from BP to Rabobank – unify their on-premises, hybrid, and multi-cloud infrastructure. And, as the digital and physical worlds come together, we are seeing real enterprise metaverse usage. From smart factories, to smart buildings, to smart cities, we are helping organizations use the combination of Azure IoT, Digital Twins, and Mesh, to help digitize people, places, and things, in order to visualize, simulate, and analyze any business process. Ecolab, for example, is using these tools to build its own platform to model and optimize water management. Across Azure, we are seeing growing adoption across every sector. CVS Health, Johnson & Johnson Medical Devices, Kyndryl, and Wells Fargo all chose our cloud as their preferred provider this quarter. Now, to data. From best-in-class databases and analytics, to AI and data governance, we have the most comprehensive data stack to help every organization turn its data into predictive and analytical power. Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development – at any scale. Data volumes and transactions increased over 100 percent year over year. With Azure Synapse, we’re removing traditional barriers between enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics so anyone can collaborate, build, and manage analytics solutions. Data governance is emerging as an important and growing category. And Azure Purview is leading here, helping thousands of organizations achieve a more complete understanding of their data estate. In AI, we have one of the most powerful supercomputers in the cloud, and we’re using it not only to train new models but to deliver them as platforms to our customers. Our new Azure Open AI Service is in preview and that brings together advanced language models with the enterprise capabilities of Azure. GitHub Copilot is using this capability to help developers write better code. More broadly, we continue to see strong usage across our Cognitive Services, with over 30 million hours of speech transcribed last quarter, up nearly 2X compared to a year ago. Now, to developers. From GitHub to Visual Studio, to Azure PaaS services, we have the most popular tools to help every developer go from idea to code and code to cloud. As companies prioritize embedding security into their developers’ workflow, we’re investing across GitHub to secure open source. Increasingly, every devsecops workflow will start with GitHub Advanced Security, and we’re seeing strong demand from both digital natives like Afterpay and Mercari, as well as established companies like 3M and Bosch. And organizations are increasingly turning to both Visual Studio and our PaaS services, like Container Apps and Chaos Studio, to streamline development and build modern, more resilient cloud-native applications. Now, to Power Platform. Low code/no-code tools are rapidly becoming a priority for every organization’s digital capability building. We’re innovating to help organizations like Airbus, Centrica, and Johnson Controls rapidly scale their use of Power Platform, using end-to-end suite to automate workflows, create apps, build virtual agents, and analyze data. At H&M, more than 30,000 employees have used Power Platform to drive productivity gains. They’ve created more than 1,500 applications, flows, and dashboards to date, for everything from managing office capacity to tracking team goals. And, at Kroger, more than 420,000 associates are using our Return to Workplace solution, which is built on Power Platform, to verify their health and vaccination status. Now, on to Dynamics 365. To counter demand shocks and supply constraints in this economy, every business will need to become a hyperconnected business, unifying data, process, and teams across the organization. Across Dynamics 365, we continue to take share, as companies turn to our expanding portfolio of business applications to address these and other challenges. With Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, we are creating a new software category to help organizations manage physical operations across diverse industries, from real estate, to retail, to factories, and construction. Companies like Chipotle and Home Depot are relying on our new Customer Experience Platform to take control of their data, connecting customer touchpoints to deliver more personalized experiences. Daimler Trucks North America is using Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Insights to preempt supply chain issues. And, just yesterday, we announced a new “logistics as a service” offering with FedEx, combining data and insights from the company’s network with Dynamics 365 to help brands better fulfill, ship, and service customer orders. Now, to industry solutions. Just over a year ago, we introduced our first industry cloud offering, bringing together industry-specific customizations with our entire stack to help customers improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We now have six industry clouds, and they’re driving significant increases in usage across the Microsoft Cloud. Our Cloud for Retail was front and center at NRF, with retailers – from Ahold DELEZ and GNC – sharing how they’re using our solutions to deliver seamless customer experiences. Our Cloud for Sustainability unifies data to help customers record, report, and reduce their carbon emissions. Industry leaders, including Nissan Motor, are turning to the offering to help meet sustainability goals. Now, on to LinkedIn. We are experiencing a “Great Reshuffle” across the labor market, as more people in more places than ever rethink how, where, and why they work. In this new economy, LinkedIn has become mission critical to connect creators with their communities, job seekers with employers, learners with skills, and sellers with buyers. Last quarter, we once again saw record engagement. And LinkedIn has become one of the world’s largest platforms for professional events, with more than 24,000 events created and 1.5 million RSVPs each week. Confirmed hires were up 110 percent year over year, and we added tools to make it easier to discover open roles that align with how and where people want to work. With entrepreneurship on the rise, our new Service Marketplace has helped nearly 3 million freelancers and small businesses discover new clients. We also saw strong growth in LinkedIn Sales Solutions, which surpassed $1 billion in revenue over the past 12 months for the first time. Our Sales, Talent, Marketing, and Premium Subscriptions lines of business have now all reached this milestone. Now, to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Every organization today needs a digital fabric to connect and empower everyone inside and outside the organization, from knowledge and frontline workers to customers and partners. At the center of this digital fabric is Teams, which surpassed 270 million monthly active users this quarter. Organizations are using Teams to run their business with collaborative applications that bring business process data right into the flow of work. Monthly usage of third-party applications and custom-built solutions has grown 10X in the last two years, with new and updated apps this quarter from Atlassian, Monday.com, SAP, and Workday. United Airlines is using bots within Teams to create tighter connections between operations and flight crews. And Marks & Spencer used Power Apps and Teams to streamline internal help desk requests. As hybrid work becomes the norm, every organization will need to rethink their approach to space. With Teams Rooms, we’re bringing Teams to a growing ecosystem of devices to help people stay connected and participate fully in meetings from anywhere. The number of active Teams Rooms devices more than doubled year over year. And with Mesh for Teams, we’re bringing the metaverse to Teams, helping employees at organizations like Accenture access a shared immersive experience where they can have watercooler-type conversations, and even whiteboarding sessions. Teams is rapidly becoming the standard for unified communications. Over 90 percent of Fortune 500 companies used Teams Phone this quarter, and we continue to take share across PSTN and VOIP as organizations like Bank of Montreal, Chevron, General Motors, LVMH, and NetApp turn to Teams to meet their internal and external collaboration needs. All-up, we’re seeing Teams growth in every segment, from frontline worker usage up 2X year over year. Zebra Technologies will bring Teams “Walkie Talkie” communication to devices used by millions of employees on retail floors. And Walmart chose Teams for their more than 2 million frontline workers this quarter. And we’re expanding our opportunity with Teams Essentials, the first standalone Teams offering specifically designed to meet the needs of small businesses. It’s early days, but we’re already encouraged by strong demand. With Microsoft Viva, we’re creating a new employee experience category, combining communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights to help people feel connected to the company’s mission and culture. Now broadly available, Viva is being used by more than 1,000 paid customers – including Blum, Nationwide, and REI – to help address challenges like employee burnout and retention. All this innovation is driving growth across Microsoft 365. From Heineken to Hilton, to Zurich Insurance, organizations continue to choose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. We’ve seen a structural shift in PC demand. More than ever, people are turning to PCs to exercise their agency and unleash their creativity, whether it’s meeting in virtual reality or for remote work, writing code or collaborating in documents, livestreaming video or playing games, or for graphic design and engineering design. As new use cases are born every day, and existing ones see a resurgence, we’re experiencing a PC renaissance, with increases in time spent on PCs, and PCs per household. Three months in, we’re delighted by the response to Windows 11. We’re seeing more usage intensity and higher quality than previous versions of our operating system. And Windows took share this quarter. We are delivering Windows in new ways to meet evolving customer needs. This quarter, we introduced Windows 11 SE, a cloud-first operating system purpose-built for schools. And, with Windows 365, we are bringing the operating system to the cloud, helping businesses like Coats North America and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stream the full Windows experience to any employee device. There are now more than 1.4 billion monthly active devices running Windows 10 or Windows 11, and they’re a powerful on-ramp for both our first-party and third-party services. Windows 11 users engage with the Windows app store at nearly 3X the rate as Windows 10. And, across Bing and Edge, we are creating differentiated, high value experiences for consumers and advertisers in key verticals, including shopping. Just one year since the launch of coupon and price comparison features, Edge has already surfaced more than $800 million in savings. More broadly, we are expanding our opportunity in advertising. Over the past 12 months, our total advertising revenue, inclusive of LinkedIn, surpassed $10 billion ex TAC. And with our acquisition of Xandr, we will bring to market new advertising solutions that combine our deep audience understanding and customer base with Xandr’s large-scale data-driven platforms. Now, on to security. Cybercrime is the number one threat facing every business today. Our aim is to help organizations implement a comprehensive Zero Trust architecture that protects people, devices, applications, and data holistically across their heterogenous cloud and client environments. We protect our customers in two interconnected ways: First, we incorporate security by design into every product we sell. And, second, we deliver advanced end-to-end cross-cloud, cross-platform security solutions, which integrate more than 50 different categories across security, compliance, identity, device management, and privacy, informed by more than 24 trillion threat signals we see each day. Among analysts, we are a leader in more security categories – now 19 – than any other provider. Our multi-cloud, multi-platform innovation is driving growth. Across commercial and consumer, more than 1 billion monthly active users now rely on a Microsoft Account to securely access their favorite products and services with just one login. More than 15,000 customers now use our cloud-native SIEM, Microsoft Sentinel, to stop threats before they happen, up over 70 percent year over year. And, all-up, the number of customers that use our advanced security solutions accelerated this quarter to over 715,000. More than half have 4 or more workloads, up 75 percent year over year, underscoring our end-to-end differentiation. On average, customers save 60 percent compared to multi-vendor solutions. As a result of our customers’ trust, our security business revenue surpassed $15 billion over the past 12 months, up nearly 45 percent year over year. Now, on to gaming. The big bets we have made across content, community, and cloud over the past few years are paying off. We saw record engagement, as well as revenue this quarter. Game Pass has more than 25 million subscribers across PC and console. Our differentiated content is driving the service’s growth, and we released new AAA titles this holiday to rave reviews and record usage. 18 million have played Forza Horizon 5 to date. And more than 20 million have played Halo Infinite, making it the biggest Halo launch in history. And with our planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard, announced last week, we are investing to make it easier for people to play great games wherever, whenever, and however they want, and also shape what comes next for gaming as platforms like the metaverse develop. In closing, as digital technology as a percentage of global GDP continues to increase, we are innovating and investing across diverse and growing TAMs with a common underlying technology stack and an operating model that reinforces a common strategy, culture, and sense of purpose. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you for questions. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $51.7 billion, up 20% year-over-year. Earnings per share was 2.48, increasing 22%. The US dollar strengthened during the quarter, and as a result, FX had no impact on total company and segment revenue growth, which was a 1-point headwind compared to expectations. Despite this, we delivered another quarter of strong double-digit revenue growth in each of our business segments, reflecting our unique and differentiated market position across a connected portfolio of diverse businesses. In our commercial business, strong execution by our sales teams and partners combined with continued demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings drove significant growth in large, long-term Azure contracts, as well as increased usage of Teams and our advanced security and identity offerings. And in LinkedIn, Talent Solutions benefited from a strong job market again this quarter. In our consumer business, increased PC demand and usage, as Satya highlighted, benefitted our Windows OEM business. Continued advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn Marketing Solutions as well as Search and news advertising. And in a strong holiday quarter for gaming, we saw record revenue and engagement on the platform, with significant growth in Game Pass subscribers and first-party titles, as well as continued demand for Xbox Series X and S consoles. Now to our overall results. Commercial bookings grew 32% and 37% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the large, long-term Azure contracts noted earlier and strong execution across our core annuity sales motions. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31% and 32% in constant currency to $147 billion. Roughly 45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 26% year-over-year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 37% year-over-year, highlighting the long-term commitment customers are making to our Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 94%. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew 32% to $22.1 billion, again ahead of our expectations. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 70%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 3 points driven by improvement across our cloud services, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. As noted earlier, with the strengthening of the US dollar thru the quarter, FX had no company and segment revenue growth impact, and minimal impact on COGS and operating expense growth. Gross margin dollars increased 20%. Gross margin percentage was 67%, relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven primarily by the improvement in our cloud services noted earlier. Operating expense increased 14%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, headcount grew 16% year-over-year as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, gaming, and LinkedIn. Operating income increased 24% and operating margins expanded 1 point year-over-year to 43%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 3 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15.9 billion and grew 19% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue exceeded expectations driven by LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 14%. Office 365 commercial revenue growth of 19% was driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 16% year- over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 17%, in line with expectations and consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. Office consumer revenue grew 15%, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 19% to 56.4 million. Dynamics revenue grew 29% year-over-year driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 45% and 44% in constant currency. Continued demand for our modern, low-code app development solutions drove another strong quarter with 161% revenue growth in Power Apps. LinkedIn revenue increased 37% and 36% in constant currency, with continued strength in Marketing Solutions, which grew 43% year-over-year and better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the strong job market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and 19% in constant currency and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 13%, and operating income increased 24%. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $18.3 billion, increasing 26% year-over-year, which included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Excluding this headwind, revenue grew ahead of expectations driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 29% year-over-year. Azure and other cloud services growth of 46% was driven by continued strength in our consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 28% to over 209 million seats. In our on-premises business, revenue increased 6%, in line with expectations driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments. Enterprise Services revenue grew 8% and 7% in constant currency, driven by growth in Enterprise Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 21% and 22% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased slightly with improvements in Azure partly offset by the sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 14%, and operating income grew 26%. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $17.5 billion, increasing 15% year-over-year, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM, Surface, and Search and news advertising. Revenue growth included a 1-point FX headwind relative to expectations. Windows OEM revenue increased 25%, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by the strong PC market noted earlier, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. As a reminder, these results include roughly 6 points of positive impact from the $210-million revenue deferral related to Windows 11, which shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13% and 14% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue grew 8% year-over-year, ahead of expectations as we were able to ship more devices than anticipated into a strong demand environment. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 32%, better than expected, benefiting from the strong advertising market noted earlier. And, we saw share gains in our Edge browser on Windows 10 and 11 devices. And in Gaming, revenue increased 8%, in line with expectations. Xbox hardware revenue grew 4% and 3% in constant currency driven by continued strong demand and better than expected console supply on a strong prior year comparable that included the launch of the Xbox Series X and S. Xbox content and services revenue increased 10%, lower than expected, as strong growth in first-party titles and Game Pass subscriptions was partially offset by weaker third-party title performance. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% year-over-year. Gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points, driven by a sales mix shift to higher margin businesses and improvement in Search and news advertising. Operating expenses increased 17% driven by investments in Gaming, primarily ZeniMax, search and news advertising, and Windows marketing. Operating income grew 22% and 21% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6.8 billion, up 25% year-over-year, lower than expected, primarily due to quarterly spend volatility in the timing of our cloud infrastructure buildout. Cash paid for PP&E was $5.9 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $14.5 billion, increasing 16% year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to hardware inventory builds. Free cash flow was $8.6 billion, up 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. This quarter, other income and expense was $268 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was approximately 17%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I’d like to provide a couple of reminders. First, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, although we do expect it to close during Q3. Second, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. With that, let’s move to our third quarter outlook. First FX. With the stronger US dollar and based on current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately 2 points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly 2 points of negative FX impact on revenue growth in Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud and 1 point in More Personal Computing. Next, we expect our differentiated market position, customer demand for our high-value hybrid and cloud offerings, and consistent execution to drive another strong quarter of revenue growth. In commercial bookings, growth should be healthy but will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable as well as low growth in the expiry base. As a reminder, the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, drive increased quarterly volatility in our bookings growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, Q3 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points driven by continued improvement across our cloud services, despite revenue mix shift to Azure. And, on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be slightly down sequentially with normal quarterly variability in the timing of cloud infrastructure buildout. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.6 and $15.85 billion. In Office 365, healthy revenue growth will be driven by the same factors as Q2 with similar seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high-teens, with continued customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the high single-digits, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, the strong job market and healthy engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the low-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the mid-20% range driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.75 and $19 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Azure, we expect revenue growth to be up sequentially in constant currency, driven by our Azure consumption business, with strong growth on a significant base. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business continued demand for our differentiated hybrid offerings should drive revenue growth in the low to mid-single digits. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $14.15 and $14.45 billion. Continued strength in PC shipments, particularly in the commercial segment, should benefit Windows OEM despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We expect Windows OEM revenue growth in the high single-digits. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive growth in the low double-digits. In Surface, revenue should grow in the mid-teens with strength from our premium devices. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-teens, against a strong prior year comparable that was driven by a recovery in the advertising market. And in Gaming, on a prior year comparable that included significant strength in hardware from our new consoles as well as across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid to high-single digits with strong engagement and continued momentum across the platform. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $15.5 to $15.7 billion and operating expense of $13.4 to $13.5 billion driven by headcount investments in high-growth, strategic areas to drive continued long-term revenue growth. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And we expect our Q3 effective tax rate to be approximately 18%, slightly higher than our full year expected tax rate of approximately 17%. And finally, for FY22, given our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our current H2 outlook, full year operating margins should be slightly up year-over-year even with the impact of changes in accounting estimates noted earlier and the significant strategic investments we are making to capture the tremendous opportunities ahead of us. In closing, digital technologies are increasingly essential to empowering every person and organization on the planet to achieve more and we are well positioned with innovative, high value products. Our diverse, yet connected portfolio of solutions span end markets, customer sizes, and business models uniquely enabling us to deliver long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let’s go to Q&A. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the questions and congratulations on a very nice quarter. I wanted to ask you guys a high-level question about the overall demand environment and whether we’ve seen any changes, given sort of the disruptions we’ve seen from Omicron and a lot of what’s going on in the environment. There’s been a narrative among software investors and a lot of time the asset prices seem the narrative. I wanted to check in with you guys on how you feel about the overall demand environment, particularly around digital transformation and how durable is that going to be into calendar year ‘22? Do you still see a lot of wood to chop, if you will, a lot of activity taking place in that direction. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith. I’ll take that and, Amy, you can add on to it. Overall, what we see is pretty strong demand signal. And quite frankly, going into the pandemic, we saw demand increase because of the constraints the pandemic put on corporations and the increased consumer activity. And then coming out of the pandemic, we are seeing actually a lot of constraints in the economy and the only resource, as I said in my remarks, that can help drive productivity, while keeping costs down, is digital tech. When I think, take something like PowerApps, it’s just a great example of something that’s right in the middle of our stack, really helps drive that next level of productivity in the labor force for any company in any industry. The demand signals we see across the stack from security to our cloud infrastructure, to business applications and solutions like Teams is very strong. And the other area obviously we’re seeing strength is in gaming. That’s where we have doubled down in terms of our consumer category creation and we see the intensity of usage and the business model diversity around games that increasingly the economics of gaming franchises is also radically becoming much more software like. We sort of overall see good demand signal across the stack. KEITH WEISS: Got it. And to be clear, the constraints that you talk about for the broader economy, headcount constraints and the like, it doesn’t sound like that’s constraining your opportunity. You’re not kind of running short on people to sell or implement your solutions or not having a hard time finding the people you need to make the investments behind the product. Is that the right read-through? SATYA NADELLA: There’s definitely a very competitive talent market, and we’re competitive in that talent market. You see it even in our op-ex projections that Amy shared. We are growing our headcount because we see the opportunity. We are not immune from what happens overall in the labor market, but I think we have a good brand and an attractive brand to both get people and to retain people with everything that we are doing. But at the same time, we do want to make sure that our channel and our ecosystem remain healthy, and all the signals at least we are getting is that there are no constraints per se, other than at the end of the day, all businesses are going to be subject to the laws of economic growth in the overall economy. KEITH WEISS: Outstanding. Thank you very much, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein: Thank you very much for taking my question and congratulations on the strong growth across the overall business and the really nice outlook. Satya given all the commentary on the metaverse, what are the key components of the metaverse or the multiple metaverses that you’re seeing? What does Microsoft have today that they’re positioned to be able to deliver to meet those requirements and what do you believe you might be lacking in the partner ecosystem to meet those requirements? Amy, with the hype cycle underway and increased industry interest in the metaverse, are you changing your investments to meet the potential opportunity? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you for the question. The way we see this is as an opportunity in a very classic Microsoft sense, both at the platform infrastructure level and on the application level. That’s why, I think, even in my remarks, I tried to reference all the places where we are investing today and seeing customer use cases really develop. The first place where we see this is the increasing digitization of people, places, and things to be able to really help businesses automate processes to the next level. Today, between Azure IoT, digital twins and Mesh, we have many examples where customers are engaged with us. That’s what will show up in Azure and we’re investing significantly there. Up the stack, I would say. Dynamics, Dynamics 365 Connected Spaces, that’s a solution that’s in preview today. That’s about really being able to take a retail space or a connected factory or a building and essentially create a complete new software category, which is about managing physical processes. Just like CRM and ERP and supply chain management, we now have a suite which is all driven by Connected Spaces, which is going to automate physical processes. Teams is going to have Mesh meetings or these immersive meetings, which will start first of all on 2D screens, whether it’s PCs or phones, and then lead up to even immersive experiences if you wear your VR or AR goggles. That’s another place. And then, of course, gaming, that will be a natural place for us. And today, if you think about the activity, when I talked about the Forza numbers, right, that’s a place where you could say already people are investing in their avatars, people are building Minecraft worlds. And so very naturally, you can see us extend gaming as the metaverse evolves. On the devices side, one of the things we’re very excited to be doing is what we’re doing with HoloLens and all the experience we’re gaining on the optics, on the silicon side, and all the way to the cloud in terms of some of the foundational services, driven by all the HoloLens use cases in the enterprise. That’s the broad portfolio. We’re going to invest across the entire tech stack. The demand will come in different forms for different categories, but we feel very well-positioned to be able to catch what I think is essentially the next wave of the internet, right? Just like the first wave of the internet allowed everybody to build a website, I think the next wave of the internet will be a more open world where people can build their own metaverse worlds, whether they’re organizations or game developers or anyone else. AMY HOOD: And Mark, maybe just add one bit of perspective to Satya’s answer, which is, I would bring people’s attention to the holistic nature in which he answered the questions starting at the platform layer, all the way up through the importance of content and app layer, and that the investment will show itself in each component as opposed to maybe in one standalone group or team. It’s because, I think, of the transition Satya just talked about. If it’s at the platform layer and it applies to all the components, it’s better to do that, frankly, across the teams where they can apply it in the right way. I think that’s how I would point to the investment showing itself. MARK MOERDLER: Thank you very much. I really appreciate it. Thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, you really underscored the strength you had on commercial bookings at 37%. Many are asking where you’re seeing the strength, and into your Azure comment, for next quarter, obviously the acceleration. What’s giving you the confidence? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Interestingly, I would not say that there is one location, and I would tie that back to the answer, actually, Satya gave to Keith’s first question, which is if the underlying driver is digitization and our belief that it impacts every industry, every end market, then you’d expect it and the nature of the commitments to show themselves on a global basis and across end markets, and that is, in fact, what we saw in Q2. I continually point out, these can be a little volatile because we really focus on getting the right deal done that matches the customer goals. And while we got a lot of those done in Q2, it can move around a little bit, as I talked about in Q1. But the execution was very good by the sales team this quarter, but I would not characterize any geo or industry as being different or distinct from others. And for a second, let me then connect that, as you asked, into how to think about the guide for Azure on a constant dollar basis being up sequentially into Q3. I sort of continually remark that these things can move around a few points here and there, and yet have the consistent sign of consumption be steady. We saw that again, frankly, Q1, Q2, Q3, consumption growth by end market, by industry, by customer size has remained quite steady. And so, while you’ll see some volatility in that number, increased data usage, the data products have really been a strong performer. I think Satya mentioned some of those in his comments. I do think in some ways they are connected, but I tend to put bookings execution on the Azure side into a long-term commitment bucket where customers are picking a partner to help them change the cost structure or the outcome structure that Satya talked about, and I tend to put these trendlines on Azure into a bucket called, you know, are we getting projects and successful projects set up at customers around the world, and both those things were very good by the sales teams. BRENT THILL: Thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. Amy, you started the fiscal year guiding to down margins, including the impact of the accounting change, and two quarters in, you’re now guiding to up margins. Even with presumably some reversal of work-from-home related T&E savings, even with what I’m assuming is an uptick in labor costs, can you unpack that a little bit? Is it sales mix where some of the high margin businesses like Windows have outperformed? I’d love to hear a little color. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. I think it’s really a combination of things, as it is when you go through a fiscal year. Really, I believe that our execution in a very good demand environment has given confidence. Revenue performance has been quite consistent, to your point. We have seen some continued upside in OEM, we’ve seen strength in gaming, we’ve seen strength in our Microsoft cloud products, we’ve seen good consistency out of Dynamics. At some level, when you really wanted to look at the trendline, you’d say this has been a very consistent execution by the team across really most of the business units. And so, if you think about then what goes into confidence is when you start to add headcount and you add headcount with goals of ROI and you look at that accountability, I feel like the teams have done a nice job. Where we’ve added heads, they’ve been into strong markets. They’ve executed well. Sales teams have done the same. And then on top of that, Karl, I would say there’s been good execution on the gross margin numbers. I tend to be an operating margin focused communicator with you all and inside company, but gross margins have also been quite good. The teams have executed well on cost per goals through the year. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. That’s helpful. Congrats. AMY HOOD: Thanks. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) PHIL WINSLOW, Credit Suisse: Hi, team, and congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in an Office 365 commercial, obviously another strong quarter there, both in terms of revenue, but also seat growth. Amy, in your commentary, you highlighted SMB seat performance, as well as frontline workers, and Satya mentioned a doubling of the frontline workers year over year, which is impressive. But you also commented on revenue per user going up. I wonder if you could help us to kind of walk through the growth algorithm here, call it the P Times Q, because there are different trends going on both the P and the Q, and just sort of how there might be a change going forward versus what you have seen. AMY HOOD: Sure, let me take a shot at that one, Phil. This is one where we do have, it is a P times Q that I think we try to disclose, but there’s a couple of currents running through that, and maybe take a second to walk you through those. Absolutely on seat growth, I think we are encouraged as we focus on more products that are more specific to those unique scenarios that face small businesses and frontline workers and really bringing the value of Microsoft 365 to them. I think you’re even seeing that in offers like Teams Essentials, right, where it’s a concerted effort to realize the challenges can be different in that part of the market and improving our execution. You’re seeing that in continued seat growth over, I would say, I feel good about those numbers, over the past probably six quarters, with continued good execution on those. Now, however, those do often come at lower revenue per month than we would see in our enterprise businesses buying the full suite of products. In some ways, this very strong seat growth at the frontline worker and small business units do mask some of the progress that we’ve been making, in particular I’m thinking, offers in the enterprise, value props that are really resonating, and E5, and Satya may bring up some other ones. He mentioned quite a few in his comments, security, compliance, and increasingly voice as a value prop. And so sometimes, to your point, increasing seats at lower average price points can mask a bit of progress that we’re making on ARPUs in the enterprise. PHIL WINSLOW: Great. Thanks. Keep up with the great work. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Phil. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Great. Congrats on another record quarter. Satya, there’s a massive skills gap within the IT industry, and it’s particularly acute in cybersecurity, where I notice Microsoft’s campaign that kicked off in Q2 to help skill and recruit 250,000 cyber jobs by 2025, which is quite a bold undertaking. Can you comment on the extent to which the gap is filled by people versus products and automation, and also the extent to which Microsoft sees cybersecurity as its responsibility versus it being a commercial opportunity that you can continue to monetize? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: A great set of questions. On the first one, I think it’s, first and foremost, we absolutely need the skills and the people, and for the people to be sort of more evenly distributed in the broader economy, public sector, private sector, people who are working on behalf of small businesses, because absolutely, as digital tech becomes more pervasive across IT, as well as OT across the economy, I think the cyber threat is just going to be more pervasive. And so therefore, we need the people and the skills, and we will do everything there in our power to sort of make sure that that happens, in terms of democratizing even how one acquires these skills. That’s kind of where not that –we have to take a broader definition of what these skills are and how one can acquire the certifications. And this is where what we’re doing even with LinkedIn, I’m very, very bullish on. On the product side as well, like something like Sentinel, I do believe, for example, we are now doing very large scale AI on all of those signals that go into our cloud-native SIM, and that I think is going to help sift through signal from noise and help the productivity of the cyber-professionals in any organization. We are excited about how that workflow gets more efficient. To your point, one of the fundamental responsibilities for us as a platform company is by design. It’s all about shifting left on security and building it in to the products. If anything, when we think about our monetization, our monetization is about really recognizing that the real world is not some homogenous Microsoft infrastructure world. It is a multi-cloud, multi-platform world, and we will definitely monetize those aspects that we have best of breed solutions and suites and offerings. And by the way, as I said in my remarks, the people who are adopting the Microsoft solutions are saving 60%. And so, to some degree, there is real time to value and cost savings for anybody who’s using our solution. We’re going to be very, very mindful of our responsibility, as you said, and at the same time, we think we have a security opportunity in being able to secure the entire heterogeneous digital estate of our customers. BRAD ZELNICK, Deutsche Bank: Thank you very much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) RISHI JALURIA, RBC: Wonderful. Thank you so much for taking my questions, and nice to see continued strength in the business. Maybe I wanted to ask a little bit philosophically, Satya. The pandemic clearly accelerated everyone’s timeline to migrate to the cloud, even if there wasn’t necessarily a big pull forward there. As we think about a post-Omicron world where there is some level of office re-openings and visibility into that, how should we think about the potential to see maybe another wave or another acceleration of those cloud migrations with that ability to have in office and have hybrid work? Maybe walk us through that. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, I mean, as I said, some of the contours of demand will change. For example, one of the solutions I highlighted is coming out of the pandemic, we built in Dynamics a Supply Chain Insights module. We were seeing significant demand for what was our Customer Insights module going into the pandemic because everybody needed to deploy essentially their online presence and use customer data to be able to reach customers, and that’s how commerce happened during the pandemic. Coming out of the pandemic, we were hit with supply chain issues, so supply chain insights became the most important thing. That’s where the demand picked up. As I look at our portfolio, we are seeing a slightly different set of solutions. Same thing with Power Platform, right? When you are sort of saying, we have a labor force shortage and we need to do more with less, guess what, you turn to more automation tools, and that’s where something like Power Platform, especially given you can even train your first-line workers to be able to be app builders and automate workflows, that’s proving to be a productivity driver. We are seeing differences in demand. I think the stable state here would be the structural shift that’s happened because of the pandemic, combined with even the some of these constraints, whether there is supply shocks or others, will hopefully go away. But the one thing that isn’t going to go away is the need for increasing levels of digitization, both in terms of tools that people use to improve the productivity of your op-ex and the COGS you have in your enterprise will probably now have a digital component to it, because that’s where the leverage of cost will come. That’s what we are betting on. I always go back to that simple formula, as a percentage of GDP, what is IT spend, broadly defined, and what is it going to be a year from now, two years from now, five years from now, 10 years from now? It’s just going to be more. And we’ve got to do a good job of seeing the trends before that conventional wisdom and gaining share, and so that’s where we’ll remain focused. RISHI JALURIA: Wonderful. Thank you so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Rishi. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you AMY HOOD: Thank you (Break for direction.) END "
MSFT,2022,1,2021-10-26T12:00:00-00:00, "Microsoft FY22 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, October 26, 2021 BRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

We are off to a fast start in fiscal 2022, with Microsoft Cloud quarterly revenue surpassing $20 billion for the first time, up 36% year over year. The case for digital transformation has never been more urgent or more clear. Digital technology is a deflationary force in an inflationary economy. Businesses – small and large – can improve productivity and the affordability of their products and services by building tech intensity. The Microsoft Cloud delivers the end-to-end platforms and tools organizations need to navigate this time of transition and change. Now I’ll highlight examples of our innovation and momentum, starting with Azure. Every organization will need a distributed computing fabric across the cloud and the edge to rapidly build, manage, and deploy applications anywhere. We are building Azure as the world’s computer, with more data center regions than any other provider, delivering faster access to cloud services, while addressing critical data residency requirements. And we’re partnering with mobile operators – from AT&T and Verizon in the United States, to Telefonica and BT in Europe, Telstra and Singtel in Asia-Pacific – as they embrace new business models and bring ultra-low latency compute power and storage to the network and the enterprise edge. 78% of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. And with Azure Arc, customers like Nokia, Royal Bank of Canada, and SKF can deploy and run applications at the edge or in multi-cloud environments. Organizations also prefer our cloud to power the mission critical apps they rely on every day. GE Healthcare and Procter & Gamble migrated critical workloads to Azure this quarter. And leading companies in every industry – including Bertelsmann, Kimberly-Clark, the NBA, SoftBank, and ThyssenKrupp – all chose Azure for their SAP workloads. Now, on to data. The leading indicator of digital transformation success is an organization’s ability to turn data into analytical and predictive power. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics into a comprehensive solution. With Synapse Link for Dataverse, organizations can analyze data from business applications like Power Platform and Dynamics 365 with just a few clicks. With Synapse Link for Cosmos DB, they can run real-time, no-ETL analytics over their operational data. And, with Power BI, anyone in the organization can access these insights. Thousands of active Power BI customers are using Synapse today. More than ever, every business needs a holistic understanding of its data estate and Azure Purview, now generally available, is helping organizations, such as FedEx, manage and govern on-prem, multi-cloud, and SaaS data. Now, on to developers. As every company becomes a digital company, they will need standardized tools to modernize existing apps and build new ones. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most used and loved developer tools to build any app for any platform. GitHub is now home to 73 million developers, up 2X since our acquisition three years ago. More and more businesses are choosing GitHub Enterprise to provide their developer teams the most advanced platform to build, ship, and maintain software. This quarter alone, we introduced more than 70 enterprise features. 84% of the Fortune 100 use GitHub, and we are seeing growing usage from digital-native companies and the world’s most established firms, from Pinterest to Procter & Gamble, from Stripe to Société Générale. We are rapidly innovating in AI, and our large scale models are powering everything from meeting recaps in Teams, to helping developers code in GitHub, to “next best action” in Dynamics 365. And as machine learning continues to mature, managing the lifecycle of models, or MLops, has become more prevalent, and Azure ML is now the go to tool for data science teams. And, large organizations – from Ecolab to Providence Healthcare – are relying on Azure AI to better meet customer needs. Now, to Power Platform. With Power Platform, we are helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. All-up, Power Platform now has nearly 20 million monthly active users, up 76% year over year. Power Apps is the undisputed market leader in low code/no-code tools, now with 10 million monthly active users. 91% of the Fortune 500 use the service to build applications. And 129 organizations have more than 10,000 users, including 3M, EY, GSK, Marks & Spencer, Sony, and ZF Group. Now, to Dynamics 365. Going forward every business process will be collaborative, powered by data and AI, and will bridge the digital and physical worlds. Dynamics 365 ushers in this hyperconnected business process era. We continue to gain share. With Dynamics 365 and Teams, we are creating a new category of collaborative applications that help businesses like Rockwell Automation and Willis Towers Watson surface data and insights across the organization. Dynamics 365 Customer Insights leads its category. Customers like Meijer are using it to create 360-degree view of customers, in order to deliver more personalized experiences. All-up, the number of customer profiles increased 174% year over year. Now, on to industry. Our industry clouds bring together capabilities across the entire Microsoft Cloud, along with industry-specific customizations, to improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. We’re seeing strong customer adoption of our new industry cloud for healthcare, and our clouds for financial services and manufacturing will become more broadly available next week. Sustainability is an existential priority for our society and for every business today. And when we think about our approach to sustainability, it’s more than just the carbon footprint of our own datacenters. With our Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, we’re creating an entirely new business process category to help organizations monitor their carbon footprint across their operations. The world’s largest baking company, Grupo Bimbo, for example, is using our tools to report, record, and reduce its emissions in every country where it operates. Now, to LinkedIn. We’re experiencing a “Great Reshuffle” across the global labor market as people are rethinking not only where and how they work, but why. And as more people change jobs than ever before, we saw record engagement as they increasingly turn to LinkedIn to connect, learn, grow, and get hired. LinkedIn now has nearly 800 million members. Confirmed hires on the platform increased more than 160% year over year, and this quarter we launched new ways to help job seekers discover roles that align with how they want to work. In a rapidly evolving labor market, companies are increasingly turning to LinkedIn Learning to upskill and reskill their employees. We now have over 15,000 enterprise customers of LinkedIn Learning, and we’re expanding our opportunity in the creator economy, including offering new ways for LinkedIn Learning instructors to build their audiences and connect with learners live. Businesses continue to choose LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals. LinkedIn advertising revenue was up 61% year over year. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Flexibility and productivity are not mutually exclusive. We are innovating to empower people to have impact – from home, in the office, and anywhere in between. Microsoft Teams is the only solution that supports all the ways people work. Usage has never been higher. 138 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and more than 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. Updates to Teams Rooms, including new AI-powered cameras and spatial audio, ensure every meeting attendee is always a first-class participant. The rise of hybrid work is transforming the enterprise phone market, and we are taking share across PSTN and VOIP. Calls originating from Teams chats increased 50% this quarter, compared to a year ago. Operator Connect enables organizations to bring their existing service directly into Teams. And leaders in every industry, including Schlumberger, Westpac, ZF Group, REI, and SAP, chose Teams Phone this quarter to meet all of their internal and external calling needs. Moving forward, organizations will need a digital fabric that spans organizational boundaries to address key challenges like customer service swarming and supply chain resilience. With Teams Connect, employees across multiple companies can chat and collaborate as one extended team without switching tenants. In private preview, we’ve already seen strong interest and usage from companies like LVMH and WPP. Teams by itself has become a first-class platform for application development. For example, employees at Levi Strauss and NTT Data are using ServiceNow apps within Teams to access critical info within the flow of work. Organizations are also using Power Platform to build their own rich, collaborative applications right within Teams for everything from curbside pick up to care team coordination. All-up, the number of organizations with more than 10,000 users integrating their third-party and line-of-business apps with Teams increased 82% year-over-year. We’re creating a complete new category with Microsoft Viva, which brings together communications, knowledge, learning, resources, and insights. Our acquisition of Ally.io, a leader in the fast-growing objectives and key results category, adds new tools to help employees drive outcomes, not just output in hybrid work. Avanade, Old Mutual, Paypal, and Toyota North America all chose Viva to help strengthen connections between employees and their mission, between employees and managers, and drive individual empowerment. Across Microsoft 365, we are seeing growth in all segments, including triple digit year over year usage growth of Teams in frontline. Coles, one of Australia’s largest retailers, chose Teams to bring two-way communication to more than 120,000 frontline employees. And Chevron, H&M, Lumen, and St. Jude all turned to our premium Microsoft 365 E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to Windows. Earlier this month, we launched Windows 11, the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. When I step back and reflect on the future of how we work, connect, and play, one thing is clear: The PC will be more critical than ever. There has been a structural shift in PC demand emerging from this pandemic. And we are delighted with the early response to Windows 11. With every new generation of Windows, we also unlock the next generation of hardware innovation across our ecosystem. And, together with our OEM partners, we are excited to offer the widest choice of Windows 11 devices at every price point and in every form factor this holiday. We are providing people and organizations everywhere with the most differentiated devices for productivity, learning, and gaming – and also have a massive opportunity to create a new class of applications that take advantage of the edge and AI capabilities in Windows, coupled with cloud. And Windows 11 is also the most open platform. It’s pioneering new store commerce models and policies. Both Amazon and Epic Games are bringing their marketplaces to the Microsoft Store. Now, on to security. Cybersecurity is the number one threat facing businesses today. Our goal is to help every organization strengthen its defense through the Zero Trust architecture built on end-to-end solutions that span all clouds and all platforms. We analyze over 24 trillion signals across email, endpoints, and identities each day, and translate this intelligence into innovative features to protect our customers. We have prevented more than 70 billion attacks over the past year alone. We now have nearly 650,000 customers using our security solutions, up 50% year over year. And businesses like HCA Healthcare and Siemens switched to our security solutions to protect their endpoints. In identity, Azure Active Directory now has more than 500 million monthly active users, and we’ve seen usage of third-party apps increase 1.5X year over year. And the future of security is passwordless. Nearly 240 million users have adopted passwordless login to date, and consumers can now completely remove passwords from their personal Microsoft accounts. And we’re not stopping there. Over the next five years, we will invest $20 billion to advance our security solutions and protect customers. Now, on to gaming. We continue to attract new gamers and retain those we’ve gained over the past year and a half. We saw record first quarter monetization and engagement. This holiday season will bring our biggest line up of content and exclusive games ever, with three new AAA titles – including Halo Infinite – available via our Game Pass subscription service, which continues to offer the best value in gaming. We’re also bringing cloud gaming to the console for the first time, enabling Xbox users to discover and stream more than 100 games with just a click. Cloud gaming is now available in 26 countries, including as of this quarter, in Australia, Brazil, Mexico, and Japan. We’re expanding our opportunity with independent creators, as well as top studios. Updates to Azure PlayFab make it easier for developers to integrate the creator marketplaces in games they build. And leading publishers – from Bungie to Krafton – all rely on our cloud to scale and operate their games. In closing, we have the most diversified set of digital businesses and we are innovating to expand our opportunity across the entire portfolio to help our customers in this new era. Next week, we’ll hold our flagship Ignite conference, where we will share the next chapter of the Microsoft Cloud, from the metaverse, to large scale AI, from hybrid work to hybrid infrastructure. I couldn’t be more optimistic about the opportunities ahead. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. Amy Hood: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. Our first quarter revenue was $45.3 billion, up 22% and 20% in constant currency. Earnings per share was 2.27 and increased 25% and 23% in constant currency, when adjusted for a net tax benefit of $3.3 billion related to the transfer of intangible properties this quarter. Our sales teams and partners delivered a strong start to the fiscal year. In our commercial business, customers continued to choose the Microsoft Cloud. We again saw healthy growth in our Azure consumption-based business and increased usage across products such as Teams and Power Platform as Satya reflected in his comments. In our on-premises business, annuity performance in Office and Server benefited from a greater than expected mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition. And in LinkedIn, the Talent Solutions business continued to benefit from an improved job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM performance was better than expected in a growing PC market, despite ongoing supply chain constraints. We also saw positive demand signals for Windows 11 ahead of launch, with nearly all devices built this quarter eligible for upgrade. Microsoft 365 subscription growth drove Office consumer results. Advertising market growth drove another strong quarter in LinkedIn as well as Search and News advertising. And in Gaming, we were able to ship more Xbox Series X and S consoles than expected, even as demand continues to exceed supply. Let’s move to our overall results. Against a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings grew 11% and 14% in constant currency, driven by consistent execution across new, add-on, and renewal sales motions. This quarter, growth was impacted by fewer large, long-term Azure contracts, which are unpredictable in their timing. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 28% and 29% in constant currency to $137 billion with a roughly equivalent split between revenue that will be recognized within, and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 95%. Microsoft cloud revenue grew 36% and 34% in constant currency to $20.7 billion, ahead of expectations. Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage decreased slightly year-over-year to 71%. Excluding the impact from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets, Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly 4 points driven by improvement in our cloud services, particularly in Azure and Office 365, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. With the weaker US dollar, FX increased total company, Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by 2 points, in line with expectations. More Personal Computing revenue growth was increased by 1 point from FX, less favorable than expected. FX increased COGS by 1 point, in line with expectations, and had no impact to operating expense, slightly more favorable than expected. Gross margin dollars increased 21% and 19% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70%, down slightly year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate discussed earlier, gross margin percentage increased roughly 1 point driven by improvements in cloud services noted earlier, partially offset by the sales mix shift to cloud. Operating expense increased 11%, lower than expected, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. At a total company level, headcount grew 14% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in key areas such as cloud engineering, sales, customer deployment, and gaming. Operating income increased 27% and 24% in constant currency. And operating margins expanded 2 points year-over-year to 45%. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins expanded roughly 4 points year-over-year. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $15 billion and grew 22% and 20% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 18% and 16% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 23% and 21% in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and all customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our advanced security, compliance, and voice offerings drove continued momentum in E5 revenue this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 17% year-over-year, driven by another strong quarter of growth in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Office commercial licensing decreased 13% and 14% in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, benefiting from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Office consumer revenue grew 10% and 8% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable, with better-than-expected growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions. Over the past two years, our Microsoft 365 subscriber base has grown over 50%, reaching 54.1 million this quarter. Dynamics revenue grew 31% and 29% in constant currency. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 48% and 45% in constant currency with continued strong demand for Power Apps, which grew 202% and 197% in constant currency. And in LinkedIn, revenue increased 42% and 39% in constant currency, with continued strength in Marketing Solutions and better-than-expected performance in Talent Solutions from the improved job market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 22% and 20% in constant currency and gross margin percentage increased slightly. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvement across all cloud services. Operating expense increased 7%, and operating income increased 33% and 29% in constant currency. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17 billion, increasing 31% and 29% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by continued customer demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 35% and 33% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services grew 50% and 48% in constant currency, ahead of expectations, driven by our consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base grew 30% to over 196 million seats. In our on-premises business, on a low prior year comparable, revenue increased 14% and 13% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Strength in our annuity business was driven by healthy demand for our hybrid offerings that include Windows Server and SQL Server running in multi-cloud environments and higher in-period revenue recognition, including benefit from annuity purchasing ahead of the Windows Server 2022 launch. Enterprise Services revenue grew 9% and 8% in constant currency, driven by growth in Microsoft Consulting Services and Enterprise Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 28% and 26% in constant currency and gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage increased roughly 2 points driven by improvements in Azure, partially offset by sales mix shift to Azure. Operating expense increased 13% and 12% in constant currency, and operating income grew 39% and 37% in constant currency. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13.3 billion, increasing 12% and 11% in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows OEM and Gaming. Windows OEM revenue increased 10% driven by a stronger than expected PC market, particularly in the commercial segment, which has higher revenue per license. These results include roughly 7 points of impact from the $210-million revenue deferral related to Windows 11 licenses sold to OEMs prior to general availability. The deferral was lower than expected as OEMs prioritized upgrade-eligible device builds early in the quarter. Windows commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 12% and 10% in constant currency driven by demand for Microsoft 365. Surface revenue declined 17% and 19% in constant currency on a strong prior year comparable. Search and news advertising revenue ex TAC increased 40% and 39% in constant currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from the advertising market noted earlier. And in Gaming, revenue increased 16% and 14% in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Better than expected console supply and continued strong demand resulted in Xbox hardware revenue growth of 166% and 162% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue increased 2% and was relatively unchanged in constant currency against a strong prior year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 10% and 8% in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by a sales mix shift to gaming hardware. Operating expenses increased 15% driven by the Zenimax acquisition as well as Windows 11 marketing. Operating income grew 7% and 5% in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $7.4 billion, in line with expectations, and cash paid PP&E was $5.8 billion. Our capital investments, including both new data center regions and expansion in existing regions, continue to be based on significant customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $24.5 billion, increasing 27% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 30% year-over-year. This quarter, other income and expense was $286 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 16%. And finally, we returned $10.9 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I’d like to provide a couple of reminders. First, the outlook we give, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a US dollar basis. Second, my remarks for the next quarter do not include the impact from the Nuance acquisition, which we now expect to close by the end of Q2 or early Q3. With that, let’s move to our second quarter outlook. In our commercial business, our differentiated market position, compelling solution portfolio, and consistent execution should drive another strong quarter. Commercial bookings growth should again be healthy but impacted by modest growth in the Q2 expiry base and the normal quarterly volatility from large, long-term Azure contracts previously discussed. Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 2 points year-over-year. Excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate previously discussed, Q2 gross margin percentage will increase roughly 2 points driven by continued improvement across our cloud services, despite revenue mix shift to Azure. Longer term, we expect the Microsoft cloud gross margin percentage to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our Microsoft cloud services, and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers’ success. And, on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in line with last quarter, as we continue to invest to support growing demand. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue at the total company and all individual segment levels by approximately 1 point and have no impact on total COGS or operating expense growth. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $15.7 and $15.95 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with healthy seat growth across customer segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high-teens, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-teens, with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, a strong job market and continued engagement on the platform should drive revenue growth in the mid-30% range. And in Dynamics, we expect revenue growth similar to Q1 driven by strength in Dynamics 365, including continued momentum in Power Apps. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $18.1 and $18.35 billion. Revenue will continue to be driven by Azure which, as a reminder, can have quarterly variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue recognition depending on the mix of contracts. In Q2, we expect healthy, broad-based growth in our Azure consumption business, consistent with recent trends. And our per-user business, while continuing to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, should see a moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, on a higher prior year comparable, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid solutions. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue growth to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $16.35 and $16.75 billion. Despite ongoing supply chain constraints, OEM revenue should grow low to mid-teens including 6 points of impact from the $210-million Windows 11 revenue deferral that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive low double-digit growth. In Surface, we expect revenue to decline in the single digits as we continue to work through supply chain uncertainty particularly in our premium devices. In Search and news advertising ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the low to mid-20s. If supply chain uncertainty reduces advertising budgets, our results would be negatively impacted. And in Gaming, on a high prior year comparable that included the launch of our new consoles and strength across Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the high single-digits. Console sales will continue to be impacted by supply chain uncertainty. And in Xbox content and services, we expect revenue growth in the mid-teens with strong engagement on the Xbox platform, in a holiday quarter that will include several AAA title launches. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $17 to $17.2 billion and operating expense of $12.7 to $12.8 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 effective tax rate to be approximately 17%. In closing, we are off to a strong start in FY22 with tremendous opportunity to drive sustained, long-term revenue growth. We remain focused on growing high value usage across our differentiated Microsoft cloud offerings and delivering exciting new consumer experiences with Windows 11, Surface, and our Xbox gaming platform as we enter the holiday season. Our consistent approach to investing for these and other future opportunities, while continuing to deliver solid operating performance, will drive strong results throughout FY22 and beyond. Now, Brett, let’s go to Q&A. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys, for taking the question and congratulations on another remarkable quarter. Satya, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the edge computing opportunity, something that you started off your remarks with, and also something that we’re hearing a lot of chatter about within the investor community and within the technology community. Can you talk to us about how you think about sizing that opportunity in terms of the programable edge, and maybe help us understand the Microsoft architectural approach versus perhaps some of the competitors coming into the marketplace from the CBN perspective, who are talking about the competitive differentiation by having more of a last mile solution? Can you help us kind of understand the differentiation in those approaches? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so much, Keith, and great question, because we’ve always, as you know, Keith, architected Azure for the distributed computing fabric to remain distributed. In other words, when we talked about hybrid computing even five years ago, the idea was always that we will always have a cloud, and then we will have a distributed cloud infrastructure for application deployment. When we think about cloud plus edge, we even put even the multi-cloud control plane in there, right? Whether it is what’s happening with, say, 5G and how naturally compute will go to where data is getting generated with low latency access to a factory floor, to a hospital, to cities where you want to play X cloud gaming, that’s sort of one phenomena. The other is just literally treating every cloud, whether it’s the on-premise datacenter, it’s the other public cloud, and our public cloud, and being able to use Azure Arc and its control plane to ease the deployment across all clouds, that’s another thing that we are seeing. When I think about what is going to be key in such a distributed world is having that full suite of application infrastructure, right, all the way from the management and security control plane, something like Azure Active Directory managing the security principles and identities, and to management control planes like Azure Arc. And so, we feel well-positioned for it. And I think that the multi-cloud, multi-edge world is sort of really how we build Azure in the first place. And I think we’re still very early in all of that playing out, but we feel well-positioned. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, commercial bookings up 14% is impressive, but it’s slowed down from last quarter’s 25 against a more difficult comp. I think you’d mentioned some color around Azure, and the size and duration. Can you just, maybe anything else you would call out there? I realize it’s coming off the tough comps. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Yeah, I think the important thing when you think about bookings performance is to talk about what happened before you get to those volatiles from the large Azure commitments that create some of the tough comparables that we’re talking about. And that’s really the opportunity to execute against selling the Microsoft day-to-day, right, which is Dynamics, Microsoft Cloud, GitHub and the broader universe. Our execution on that was actually quite good, very good renewals, very good recapture rates, very good add-ons, meaning you sell outside of the normal pattern. And so, I feel very good. It’s very consistent execution, to your point, Brent, this quarter versus others on that front. And then, to your point, it’s sort of important not to time some of these larger, long dated Azure contracts. That’s where the volatility is. The day-to-day execution of Azure commitments actually was very consistent. The volatility comes with some of the bigger things, and a lot of them in Q4, less on a comparable basis in Q1. And that happens from time to time. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. Amy, heading into this Q1 release, I’d say there was a higher than normal level of worry from investors about your Windows PC segments, in light of all of the unit shipment and supply chain issues. And yet, you put up a Windows OEM number that blew away your guidance. And your guidance for the Windows OEM business in December was also, I think, way above what people are modeling. I guess, in essence, how did you dodge that bullet? Amy, maybe you could unpack that OEM performance for us and your view into the second half of the fiscal year. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. I want to start by saying and repeating something that Satya, I think, was careful to include in his remarks. And it is the central nature of the PC to really the nature of both hybrid work, and fundamentally, about getting jobs done. And I think the central role it’s played, we’ve talked about, I think now for a number of quarters. And I think the reality of that continues to exist, and I think become more real for people as we talk about what hybrid is going to look like and continue to learn what hype is going to look like. And to that end, PCs, the market grew this quarter and it was constrained by supply. I believe Q2 will also be a strong demand quarter that is constrained by supply. But even with that, we see a growing market. And in particular, in both Q1 and Q2, we see a strong demand in the commercial segment. And I think that ties directly back to some of Satya’s comments about the central nature of the device. Then, of course, we do get some benefit, Karl, because revenue per license is higher in commercial than it is in the broad market. Those things together, which is a growing market, strong Windows performance within that market, and commercial, in particular, and then the resulting higher revenue per license results in, I think, a very strong position in Q1 and Q2. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Got it. Congrats on that result, Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you very much. And Satya, Amy, congratulations on the really strong quarter. With inflation, at least in the U.S. increasing and likely to further accelerate due to government spending, Amy, how do you think this increasing inflation will impact your customers and your business? And Satya, in your remarks, you discussed how digital is deflationary in inflationary world. Can you give more color on how the shift to cloud and digital offset inflationary pressure beyond purely pricing? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll just start, and then, Amy, you can add to it. In an inflationary environment, the first place any business should go to is how do you really ensure that they’re able to get productivity gains, and even dealing with constraints. For example, if you have supply chain constraints, one of the things you want to do is run your factories at the efficient frontier. That means things like digital twins simulation are the ones where you are going to make sure that every production run has the least amount of wastage. I think any which way you look, whether it’s in the knowledge worker, first line worker, whether it’s actually digital twins and simulation, all of those things are going to be the best way for any company to deal with inflationary pressures, so that they can in fact have the best productivity, and thereby, the best ability to be able to meet aggregate demand out there. That’s why we are very, very excited about sort of making sure our software products are available to our business customers all around to be able to manage through this inflationary environment. And I’ll let Amy add to that. AMY HOOD: Yeah, thanks, Satya. And I think, really, Satya got to the heart, Mark, of where I tend to go when you think about it – when you see the intensity of customers across industries and across geographies wanting to adopt digital technology for many of the reasons Satya just explained. And there’s numerous scenarios across, I think, most industries. That acceleration, of course, regardless, frankly, of the overall environment is a place where we feel like we offer the best portfolio at the Microsoft Cloud and with our industry clouds to make that doable with a very fast time-to-value. And so, our ability to execute against that, regardless of the spend environment, means we’ve got the right portfolio at a high value to customers that’s deployable quickly that can get them results when they need it. And I think that’s reflected most of the surveys that really point to preference for our cloud to help customers do that. While, of course, it’s hard to predict what any quarter or second half will do, the things I believe to be sustainable are a push to digital, a push to clouds that help customers get value quickly, and us being a trusted advisor and partner to help that happen. MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you, that’s extremely helpful. I appreciate it and congrats again. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Hi, thank you very much. Great quarter. You gave us great, useful perspective on inflation. Curious if you can expand your thoughts, Satya and Amy, on the labor shortage we’re seeing in the tech market. How are you dealing with that? And also a little bit more of a deeper perspective on supply chain and how does Microsoft get visibility, considering that you’re growing a cloud business near capex commitments seem to be quite impressive? How much visibility do you have into component availability and your ability to ramp up your capex? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks, Kash, for the questions. On the labor market – maybe I’ll start, Amy, you can add to this – all up, the first place where we are very, very focused on is making sure that, with LinkedIn, we are doing everything to help everyone find their best economic opportunity. And when Ryan Roslansky, who’s the CEO of LinkedIn, talks about the Great Reshuffle, I think, along with the hybrid work change, there is a real question everybody’s asking, not only where and how they work, but why they work. And so, to be able to make sure that we can help them find the opportunity that they are looking for is, I think, the most critical work that we can be doing. The second side to this, though, is also to take the productivity of the people, whether they’re on the frontlines and the first line workers or the knowledge workers or even software developers, and making sure that they have the best tools, whether it’s the GitHub harness and Visual Studio Code for people who are developers, or whether it is Power Apps, or whether it is the Office 365 and then Microsoft 365 tooling to help them be most productive. That’s, I think, the thing that we are very, very focused on because it’s key to dealing with labor shortages is productivity gains. And that plus the work we’re doing in LinkedIn is where we are focused on. With that, Amy, I’ll hand it over to you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Satya. And Kash, as you probably noted, I did talk about, this quarter, we did add a year over year of 14% headcount growth. And I think that’s important because when you talk about how, what and why, we do remain focused on being a great employer to help people achieve those goals and be able to achieve them here. Secondly, you asked some good questions about the supply chain impact, and specifically around datacenter, given our spend this quarter, and my guidance that should be similar next. A lot of that, Kash, is long lead time. We do have good understanding of lead times required to meet the capacity and signals that we’re seeing. I think we do a good job managing that. It’s not to say we’re not impacted. Multiple suppliers are important to be able to manage through that, and I feel the team has done a very good job. In terms of specific impacts, I noted it in some of my remarks. I do think demand will exceed supply in PCs and Surface, for us, this quarter, particularly in premium devices and consoles for Xbox. And another challenge I noted will just be we’ll just need to watch the advertising market through the quarter, because obviously, their willingness to spend is entirely connected to their supply as well. KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Brilliant. Thank you so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. Could you speak a little bit to your – in your remarks, you talked a lot more about the hybrid cloud and how server and tools are seeing a lot of benefits from that. What are you seeing on the client side about that dynamic in terms of people moving to the cloud and kind of workloads migrating over there, and hence, there’s less server and tools versus actually kind of that being a net benefit for you. It seems like the pendulum is swinging the other direction for you. Some help there would be helpful, thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Maybe I can talk a bit to sort of what we are seeing. Take the most, I would say, the classic model of lift, shift and modernize motions, which is, I think, at the core of hybrid cloud. That’s still in early innings. Every day, I wake up to talk to customers who are planning out that motion and making sure that they’re able to modernize their entire application portfolio in various ways. That’s obviously still a very, very strong. The interesting thing for us, even in that context, is even in the height of our success in the client server area, we really were never a tier one company, whereas now we are in the sense that you take all the SAP workloads that are running on Azure, which I talked about, or other tier one workloads that are migrating, whether it’s HPC or transactional database workloads. That’s the other thing which is happening, is real production workloads moving over. And then on the data estate, that’s the place where perhaps we’re seeing significant traction. And I referenced that in some of my remarks all the way from what’s happening with, say, operational data stores like Cosmos DB with Synapse link to Synapse or Power BI to Synapse, or in fact, Dynamics 365 Dataverse to Synapse. There’s tons and tons of coming together of the data estate with, for example, regulatory requirements. Now there, you need to have real governance on data. That’s where Azure Purview becomes, again, a pretty big driver of that data gravity to the cloud from a governance perspective. The other side of this is what’s happening with dev tools, right? When you start having your CICD to your cloud, then modern, new applications and the agility with which you build, so with GitHub, VS Code becoming essentially default for any modern dev shop in the enterprise or otherwise, that’s the other thing that we see. But perhaps more than anything else, the interesting circuit for us is what happens with Teams, right? With Teams, you suddenly now have a new platform in which applications get hosted, whether it’s developed by the enterprise or by third party, and I referenced that in my remarks. And those applications in many cases get built on our cloud, use things like Azure DB, use things like Power Platform. And so, the reinforcing and compounding side of Teams to Power Apps to Dynamics to Azure is probably one of the most unique things we are seeing in terms of new applications getting built. And then there is the cloud plus edge, which I referenced in the answer to the first question, which is in a multi-cloud, multi-edge world, you still need a control plane that manages all that complexity. And that’s where something like Azure Arc and GitHub become the two standards. You develop in one place, you deploy in one place and then you propagate through every cloud that you want to deploy it. AMY HOOD: And Raimo, just maybe to add, you may have been asking also just about the nature of some of the comments I was making about on-prem server results, and it really points to hybrid strength. That’s the way I tend to think about it, and whether that’s a fact that people are committed to Windows and SQL Server, and whether they run that in Azure or whether they run it in a multi-cloud environment, it’s a commitment to the platform. And so, I just wanted to make that probably more clear as one of the drivers of our server products and cloud KPI execution this quarter. RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclay’s: Thank you, very clear. Congrats! BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRAD REBACK, Stifel: Great, thanks very much. Recently, several of your tier one SI’s have talked about having trouble hiring fast enough to keep up with demand. And clearly, your results sort of speak to that. But as we look going forward, have you seen any early indications that customers are potentially having to slow down the pace at which they move to your commercial cloud? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, I sort of point to Amy’s guide for the next quarter, as far as we are sort of looking at, is the demand across the entire stack is pretty robust. And obviously, what happens in the labor market, whether it’s in the tech labor market or any other labor market, will ultimately be something that we’ll all be subject to. But the thing at least about the software businesses are, in order to deal with a lot of other constraints, whether they are labor shortages or supply shortages, deploying digital tech is one way to sort of really overcome them. That’s sort of what we see. Clearly, I think, in the tech sector today, there is more structural demand than perhaps supply all around, but we like that position because at some level, we just want to make sure that we have the most competitive products out there. And as long as we continue to do so, I think we’ll be fine. AMY HOOD: Yeah, and I do think, frankly, Brad, just the signals we’re seeing on consumption and usage would say customers are doing a good job of figuring out the priority list that delivers value to them, as Satya is saying. I do know, obviously, that the labor market has a real impact, and I think that’s also why you’re seeing investments being made by us, in particular, into training and skilling, making deployment easier, making time to value faster, really having documentation that makes getting started and trials far more accessible. And so, when you talk about adding productivity, it’s also an investment we, at Microsoft, need to make into making our products easier and really terrific to get going on, so that you’re not constrained in the ways that you’re talking about. BRAD REBACK, Stifel: That’s great, thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. Operator, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) BRAD SILLS, Bank of America: Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. Congratulations on a real nice quarter here. Satya, I wanted to ask about comments you made earlier in the call around investments coming and new releases coming for some of the industry clouds’ financial services manufacturing. How should we view this? Should we think of the Azure business results kind of driven increasingly by these industry cloud type solutions away from horizontal type projects, like ERP, database? That’s obviously been there, but is this an incremental opportunity that’s coming that we should be thinking about? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, thank you for the question. Absolutely, we think of the Microsoft Cloud, which includes Azure, it includes Dynamics 365, it includes Microsoft 365, it includes things like Power Platform, it includes even GitHub and VS Code, that’s why we keep stressing the full modern tech stack that makes up Microsoft Cloud. And then with the industry cloud, we add value on top of that, which is specific, whether it’s in retail, whether it’s manufacturing, obviously in healthcare. And our pending Nuance acquisition will even add further to that. Obviously, we’re very, very focused on, first of all, not any, just one piece, which each one of those has to be competitive on their own. It’s the coming together of the Microsoft Cloud, and then the industry cloud adds further value on top of it. Yes, I think ultimately, our competitiveness comes because of all of those layers integrated and delivering that time-to-value for our customers while maintaining openness in each layer, and competitiveness in each layer. BRAD SILLS, Bank of America: That’s great. Thanks, Satya. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you. (Operator Direction.) END "
MSFT,2021,4,2021-07-27T12:00:00-00:00,"Microsoft FY21 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call Brett Iversen, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, July 27, 2021 BRETT IVERSEN: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks much, Brett. We had a very strong close to our fiscal year. Our commercial cloud surpassed $69 billion in annual revenue, up 34 percent. We are seeing revenue growth across industries, customer segments, and geographies, with over 50 percent of sales coming from outside the United States. We continue to grow new franchises for Microsoft in large and growing markets. In the past three years alone, gaming, security, and now LinkedIn, have all surpassed $10 billion in annual revenue. Now, I’ll highlight our innovation and our expanding opportunity across the tech stack, starting with infrastructure. Moving forward, every organization will need more ubiquitous and decentralized computing. We are the only cloud provider with the capabilities to support every organization’s multi-cloud, hybrid, and edge needs. Over the past year, we’ve added new data center regions in 15 countries across five continents, delivering faster access to cloud services and addressing data residency requirements. And now, we are taking cloud compute to the edge with 5G deployments. Our new Azure edge services help operators and enterprises deliver ultra-low latency compute fabric. And we’re also helping operators run their networks in the cloud. AT&T chose Azure to power its 5G core network, making it the first Tier 1 operator to move its existing customer traffic to the public cloud. We are also expanding our opportunity in hybrid. Today, over 75 percent of the Fortune 500 use our hybrid offerings. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premises, multi cloud, and the edge. With Arc, customers like EY and Telstra can manage their Kubernetes deployments anywhere, and deploy Azure SQL databases and run Azure applications services on any infrastructure. As the digital and physical worlds converge, we are leading in a new layer of the infrastructure stack: the enterprise metaverse. AB InBev is using our solutions – including Azure Digital Twins and Azure IoT – to optimize operations from the barley field, to the warehouse, to distribution. Customers also continue to choose our infrastructure to run mission-critical SAP solutions. Thousands of enterprises have migrated their ERP workloads to Azure, including Campbell Soup, L’Oreal, Mondelez International, ServiceNow, and even SAP. All this innovation is driving larger and more strategic Azure commitments, from industry leaders, including Mars in consumer goods, Morgan Stanley in financial services, and NEC in IT. Now, on to data. Data is the most strategic asset for every business. We are the only cloud provider that helps organizations build sovereignty over their data by bringing together hyperscale, OLTP, analytics, and governance workloads. Cosmos DB has become the go-to-database powering the world’s most demanding, mission-critical workloads. New capabilities help organizations like Albertsons, ASOS, DHL, LaLiga, Maersk, and Swiss Re optimize costs and boost performance. Walmart is using Cosmos DB to handle billions of online requests daily and ensure millions of customers receive the items they want when they need them. Azure Synapse brings together data integration, big data, and data warehouses into a single service. From ABN Amro in finance and Ameri-source Bergen in pharma, to Walgreens in retail and WPP in advertising, organizations are using Synapse to generate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. Queries performed using Synapse increased 146 percent over the last quarter alone. Now, on to developers. GitHub is used by 72 percent of the Fortune 50 to build, ship, and maintain software. Organizations like Ford, NASA, and Shopify are using new project planning capabilities to help developers better manage projects directly within their workflow. And Epic Games, Motorola Solutions, and Volkswagen’s software group all chose GitHub Advanced Security this quarter to help secure their code. We are also leading in enterprise AI. Our new Azure Applied AI Services help organizations like Dow, Lufthansa, and Samsung apply AI to common business scenarios. And live captions in Twitter Spaces are being powered by our speech services. Finally, we are bringing the power of our partnership with Open AI to both professional developers and domain experts. With GitHub Copilot, professional developers can write code faster with less work. And, using the world’s most powerful language model, GPT-3, domain experts can build apps using natural language with Power Platform. Power Platform has become the leading business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts across all functions. Power BI is the leader in business intelligence in the cloud. Organizations in every industry – including Bayer, Cerner, and Rolls-Royce – are choosing the platform to foster a data-driven culture. The number of organizations using Power Apps has more than doubled year over year. BASF chose Power Apps to give 122,000 employees the capability to build low-code/no-code apps. And at Toyota, fusion teams of pro developers and domain experts are using Power Apps and Azure PaaS services to improve quality control. All-up, Power Platform revenue increased 83 percent over the past year. And now, on to Dynamics 365. Every business function – including marketing, sales, customer support, and supply chain – will need to be reimagined for an AI-first and collaboration-first world. And the silos between communications, collaboration, and business process have to be broken down. With Dynamics 365, we’re building a new generation of business applications to help organizations adapt to this new reality. We continue to gain share. Dynamics 365 revenue accelerated for the third consecutive quarter, up 49 percent year over year. We’re helping businesses to become digitally sovereign over their customer interactions with our customer insights product, with organizations like Columbia Sportswear, GNC, and the LA Clippers are choosing to unify customer profiles and deliver more personalized experiences. We’re empowering employees for hybrid work by creating a new category of collaborative applications, bringing business process directly into the flow of work. New integrations between Dynamics 365 and Teams enable anyone in an organization to seamlessly view and collaborate on customer records within Teams, without having to purchase multiple licenses. Customers want this, and no other vendor is doing this today. And we’re helping organizations reimagine their core business processes, with new apps built for an age of omnichannel communications. With Dynamics 365 Customer Service, organizations like Coca-Cola, Renault, and Xiaomi have a single, comprehensive solution to deliver consistent and personalized support across all channels. Now, on to industry solutions. Over the past year, we’ve introduced industry clouds for financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, nonprofits, and retail. And this quarter we announced our new Microsoft Cloud for Sustainability, bringing together capabilities across our stack to create an entirely new business process category to help every organization address this very urgent need. Now, on to LinkedIn. LinkedIn’s revenue surpassed $10 billion for the first time this fiscal year, up 27 percent, a testament to how mission critical the platform has become to help people connect, learn, grow, and get hired over the course of their careers. In the past five years since our acquisition, revenue has nearly tripled, and growth has accelerated. LinkedIn has become a leader across multiple secular growth areas spanning B2B advertising, professional hiring, corporate learning, and sales intelligence. And, from LinkedIn profiles within Office, to LinkedIn Learning courses within Microsoft Viva, and LinkedIn Sales Navigator leads within Dynamics 365, we’ve brought together the power of LinkedIn and Microsoft to transform how people learn, sell, and connect. LinkedIn has more than 774 million members who are more engaged than ever. Sessions were up 30 percent this quarter, compared to a year ago. And LinkedIn’s advertising business surpassed $1 billion in revenue this quarter for the first time, up 97 percent year over year, growing three times faster than the category. Now, on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work represents the biggest change to the way we work in a generation and will require a new operating model spanning people, places, and processes. We are the only cloud that supports everything an organization needs to successfully make the shift. Microsoft Teams is the new front end. It’s where people meet, chat, call, collaborate, and automate business processes – all within the flow of work. Teams usage has never been higher. We have nearly 250 million monthly active users as people use Teams each day to communicate, collaborate, and co-author content across work, life, and learning. We are leading in the new and growing enterprise phone category. Just like video meetings, chat, and business processes happen in Teams, calls happen in Teams – creating a huge new opportunity. We have nearly 80 million monthly active Teams Phone users, with total calls surpassing 1 billion in a single month this quarter, and we’re just getting started. Teams is also at the center of orchestrating collaboration across the entire SaaS estate, from HR to marketing to finance. Leading third-party SaaS vendors – including Adobe, Atlassian, Salesforce, SAP, ServiceNow, and Workday – have now built apps that deeply integrate with Teams, bringing every business process and function directly into the flow of work. And we’re bringing Teams to consumers so people can connect and collaborate with family and friends across desktop, mobile, and the web. All this innovation is driving growth. 124 organizations now have more than 100,000 users of Teams. And nearly 3,000 have more than 10,000 users. More broadly, across Microsoft 365, we’re seeing double digit year-over-year seat growth in every segment – from frontline and small business, to enterprise. Leading companies like Bayer, Siemens, and Vodafone all chose our premium E5 offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now, on to employee experience cloud. Having a digital employee experience platform is critical for every organization. With Microsoft Viva, we’re creating an entirely new category, bringing together communications, learning, wellbeing, and knowledge directly in the flow of work. New capabilities empower leaders to build human capital, nurture wellbeing, and focus on employee results. We are seeing strong interest and early adoption in every industry – from American Express and Barclays, to AT&T and Mars. Humana chose Viva to help 26,000 employees make the shift to hybrid work, gaining insights on everything from collaboration trends to manager effectiveness. Now, on to Windows. Windows 11 is the biggest update to our operating system in a decade. We’re reimagining everything – from the Windows platform to the store – to help people and organizations be more productive and secure, and to build a more open ecosystem for developers and creators. We’re delighted by early feedback. More people have downloaded our early builds than any other Windows release or update in the history of our insider program. And, along with our OEM ecosystem, we’re excited to bring Windows 11 to new PCs beginning this holiday. And, with Windows 365, we’re creating a new category: the cloud PC. Just like applications moved to the cloud with SaaS, we’re now bringing the operating system to the cloud, enabling organizations to stream the full Windows experience to any employee’s personal or corporate device. Now, on to security. With the cybersecurity landscape more complex than ever, it’s never been clearer that every organization will need to deploy and maintain a Zero Trust security architecture. This is driving accelerated demand for our integrated, end-to-end solutions spanning identity, security, compliance, and device management, across all clouds and all platforms. No other vendor is recognized by analysts as the leader in as many categories. This is reflected in our share gains – with nearly 600,000 organizations, including FedEx, Nestle, NTT, and Volkswagen – using our security offerings across Azure and Microsoft 365. We saw a 70 percent increase in the number of small and medium business customers. And, it’s reflected in our sales growth – with annual revenue continuing to increase 40 percent year over year. We are going further to protect organizations, and our recent acquisitions of CloudKnox, ReFirm Labs, and RiskIQ bolster our security capabilities in key areas, including identity management, IoT, and threat intelligence. Now, on to gaming. Gaming is the largest category in the entertainment industry, and we are expanding our opportunity to reach the world’s three billion gamers wherever and whenever they play. We are all-in on games. At E3 last month, we unveiled our biggest games line up ever, announcing 27 new titles which will all be available to Game Pass subscribers. Game Pass is growing rapidly, and it’s transforming how people discover, connect, and play games. Subscribers play approximately 40 percent more games and spend 50 percent more than non-members. We continue to lead in the fast-growing cloud gaming market. Just last month, we made Xbox Cloud Gaming available on PCs, as well as Apple phones and tablets, via the browser in 22 countries, with more to come. Millions have already streamed games to their desktop, tablets, and phones. And the Xbox Series S and X are our fastest selling consoles ever, with more consoles sold life-to-date than any previous generation. Finally, we continue to grow our opportunity in the creator economy, adding new ways for players to build and monetize their creations in many of our most popular games – including Flight Simulator and Minecraft. Creators earned more than double what they did a year ago across our titles. In closing, going forward, every person and every organization will require more digital technology to be more resilient and to transform. We are innovating across the entire tech stack to ensure our customers succeed in this new era. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter revenue was $46.2 billion, up 21 percent and 17 percent in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.17, increasing 49 percent and 42 percent in constant currency. In our largest quarter of the year, focused execution by our sales and partner teams, along with broad-based strength across geographical markets and customer segments, drove another very strong quarter of top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business, healthy demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings, as well as increased long-term commitments to our platform, drove significant growth in the number of $10 million plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. Customer reliance on the Microsoft Cloud drove sequential increases in usage across Teams, Power Platform, and our advanced security and identity offerings, which are empowering organizations to shift to hybrid work and modernize business processes. And in LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions business, an improving job market drove strength in annual contracts and job postings. In our on-premises business, strong annuity performance across Office, Server, and Windows also benefited from a greater mix of contracts with higher in-period revenue recognition under ASC 606. In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Surface were impacted by the ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Search and LinkedIn benefited from an improved advertising market. And in Gaming, we again saw strong engagement across our platform, while demand for our Xbox Series X and S consoles continued to exceed supply. As a reminder, Q4 was the first full quarter impacted by COVID-19 a year ago across revenue and operating expense. This quarter, even with a declining expiration base, commercial bookings grew 30 percent and 25 percent in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations, driven by strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 32 percent and 31 percent in constant currency to $141 billion. Roughly 45 percent will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 25 percent year over year. The remaining portion, which will be recognized beyond the next 12 months, increased 38 percent year-over-year, highlighting the growing long-term commitment to our Microsoft Cloud. And our annuity mix increased 1 point year-over-year to 95 percent. Commercial cloud revenue, also better than expected, was $19.5 billion, as growth accelerated to 36 percent and 31 percent in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over-year to 70 percent with roughly 1 point from the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage increased despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by improvement across all our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by strategic investments we made to support significant customer engagement and usage in remote work scenarios, including free trials, flexible financing options, and capacity for cloud infrastructure usage. With the weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately 4 points, about a point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS growth by approximately 1 point and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 25 percent and 20 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 70 percent, up 2 points year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage increased despite sales mix shift to cloud, driven by the commercial cloud gross margin percentage improvement noted earlier. Operating expense grew 6 percent and 4 percent in constant currency, in line with expectations, on a prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of impact from the re-alignment of our retail stores strategy and 2 points of impact from an increase in bad debt expense. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12 percent year-over-year, as we continue to invest across key areas like cloud engineering, sales, and customer deployment. Operating income increased 42 percent and 35 percent in constant currency. And operating margins expanded 6 points year-over-year to 41 percent, including roughly 2 points of impact from the retail stores charge and increase in bad debt expense in the prior year and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $14.7 billion and grew 25 percent and 21 percent in constant currency with better-than-expected performance across all businesses. Office commercial revenue grew 20 percent and 15 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 25 percent and 20 percent in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 17 percent year-over-year, with continued recovery driving acceleration in our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings. Demand for Microsoft 365, particularly for security, compliance, and voice, drove strong E5 momentum again this quarter. E5 now accounts for 8 percent of our Office 365 commercial installed base. And on a low prior year comparable impacted by a slowdown in transactional purchasing, Office commercial licensing was ahead of expectations, down 8 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, also benefiting from higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. In Office consumer, revenue grew 18 percent and 15 percent in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew to 51.9 million, up 22 percent year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 33 percent and 26 percent in constant currency, better than expected. Dynamics 365 revenue growth was 49 percent and 42 percent in constant currency, with strong momentum in Power Apps and Power Automate, reflecting growing demand for our modern solutions to build apps and automate workflows. Dynamics 365 now accounts for over 70 percent of total Dynamics revenue. LinkedIn revenue increased 46 percent and 42 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations, against a prior year comparable impacted by the advertising and job markets of a year ago. Segment gross margin dollars increased 33 percent and 27 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was up 5 points year-over-year, primarily driven by improvement in our cloud services against a low prior year comparable impacted mostly by increased usage. The change in accounting estimate drove roughly 1 point of favorable impact. Operating expense increased 8 percent and 6 percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 62 percent and 53 percent in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $17.4 billion, increasing 30 percent and 26 percent in constant currency. We exceeded expectations across our consumption and per-user Azure businesses as well as in our on-premises server products business. Overall, server products and cloud services revenue increased 34 percent and 29 percent in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 51 percent and 45 percent in constant currency driven by strong performance across our core and premium consumption-based services. In our per-user business, the enterprise mobility and security installed base increased 29 percent to over 190 million seats. Our on-premises server business increased 16 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, driven by strong annuity performance and benefiting roughly 4 points from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier, particularly in some of our largest deals in the quarter. Enterprise Services revenue grew 12 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, driven by growth in Premier Support Services and Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 32 percent and 27 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 14 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, and operating income grew 46 percent and 39 percent in constant currency, including 3 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $14.1 billion, increasing 9 percent and 6 percent in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Windows Commercial, Gaming, and Search offsetting OEM and Surface weakness from supply chain constraints. OEM revenue declined 3 percent, and Surface revenue declined 20 percent and 23 percent in constant currency, as both were impacted by the significant supply chain constraints noted earlier in a good demand environment. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 20 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, driven by demand for Microsoft 365 with some benefit from the higher in-period revenue recognition noted earlier. Search revenue ex TAC increased 53 percent and 49 percent in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market. And in Gaming, revenue increased 11 percent and 7 percent in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 172 percent and 163 percent in constant currency, driven by demand for our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue declined 4 percent and 7 percent in constant currency against a high prior year comparable. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8 percent and 4 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased roughly 1 point year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Gaming hardware. Operating expense decreased 6 percent and 7 percent in constant currency, including approximately 13 points of impact from the retail stores charge in the prior year, and operating income grew 19 percent and 13 percent in constant currency. Now back to our total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $7.3 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand and usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for P,P, and E was $6.5 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.7 billion, increasing 22 percent year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $16.3 billion, up 17 percent, reflecting higher capital expenditures in support of our growing cloud business. For FY21, we generated over $76 billion in operating cash flow, up 26 percent year over year, and over $56 billion in free cash flow, up 24 percent year over year. This quarter, other income and expense was $310 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was approximately 15 percent. And finally, we returned $10.4 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, bringing our total cash returned to shareholders to over $39 billion for the full fiscal year. Now, before we turn to our outlook, I’d like to provide a few reminders for next fiscal year. Revenue growth rates across all segments will reflect the impact from COVID-19 a year ago, though the impacts do shift as we move through the year. Also, our FY21 operating income and margins benefited from two factors that will be significant headwinds in FY22. First, the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment resulted in $2.7 billion of depreciation expense shifting from FY21 to future periods. And second, we saved nearly $1.2 billion in operating expense from COVID-19-related restrictions, which will also moderate in FY22 as geographies re-open globally. With those reminders in place, let's move to our next quarter outlook. Accelerating digital transformation and consistent strong execution should drive another quarter of growing commitment to our Microsoft cloud. In commercial bookings, our core annuity sales motions should drive healthy growth on a growing expiry base, even against a strong prior year comparable. As always, quarterly volatility in bookings can be driven by an increasing mix of larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should decrease roughly 1 point year-over-year, with roughly 4 points of negative impact from the change in accounting estimate previously discussed. Excluding the accounting change, Q1 gross margin percentage will increase despite revenue mix shift to Azure, driven by continued improvement across our cloud services on a prior year comparable impacted by the strategic investments we mentioned earlier. Longer term, which excludes the impact of the accounting change, commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by the same three things we often discuss - revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our cloud services, and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers’ success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase revenue growth at the total company and all individual segment levels by approximately 2 points and total operating expense and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $14.5 and $14.75 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with healthy seat growth across segments and continued momentum in E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline approximately 20 percent, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, against a strong prior year comparable, we expect high single digit revenue growth with continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions. For LinkedIn, continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets should drive revenue growth in the high 30 percent range. And in Dynamics, we expect continued strength in Dynamics 365, which includes our significant momentum in Power Apps, to drive revenue growth in the high-20s. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.4 and $16.65 billion. In Azure, revenue will be driven by continued strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rate given the size of the installed base. Therefore, in constant currency, Azure revenue growth should remain relatively stable on a sequential basis. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the high-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be in the high single digits. In More Personal Computing, we have estimated the Q1 impact of the required Windows 11 revenue deferral that will shift to Q2 to be approximately $300 million. Therefore, our segment revenue outlook is $12.4 to $12.8 billion. Given the 10-point estimated negative impact from the deferral, OEM revenue should decline mid to high-single digits in Q1. In Surface, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the low teens as we continue to work through the supply chain challenges. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions should drive healthy double-digit growth. In Search ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the high-30s driven by improvements in the advertising market. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the low double-digits. Console growth will again be constrained by supply. And on a strong prior year comparable, Xbox content and services revenue should grow low single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.55 to $13.75 billion and operating expense of $11.6 to $11.7 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q1 tax rate to be approximately 16 percent, lower than our expected full year rate, given the volume of equity vests in our first quarter. In closing, we remain focused on driving revenue growth as we invest boldly against the strategic, high-growth opportunities ahead that will deliver significant value to our customers worldwide. Our outlook for FY22 reflects this, with healthy double-digit revenue and operating income growth. Together, that results in expanded operating margins in FY22 after excluding the headwinds from the useful life change noted earlier. Together with our customers and partners, we look forward to FY22. Now, Brett, let’s go to Q&A. BRETT IVERSEN: Thank you, Amy. We’ll now move to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Thank you for taking the question, guys, and congratulations on a great FY21 and a great end to the fiscal year. Satya, last year at this time, you made a comment that you really defined the conversation in software over the past year when you’re talking about an acceleration in digital transformation you saw coming out of COVID, and I think that’s evident in the results that we see here with 25 percent growth in your commercial bookings growth. What I want to ask you is the durability of that growth on a going forward basis. Was that acceleration a pull-forward of demand and at some point, we’re going to have that hard comp, or do you see durability in this acceleration on a go-forward basis? Is there a lot more to come? And then Amy, to you a similar kind of question, but more on sort of the margin side of the equation. I think your entire tenure at Microsoft has really been defined by good operational controls and ability to grow gross profit dollars well ahead of op-ex. Is that durable longer term? Is there still enough sort of efficiency gains at Microsoft to be able to keep that up over the medium term, if you will? SATYA NADELLA: Thanks so much, Keith, for the question. The way we see the results today reflect that, but more importantly, on a secular basis, as I think about, you know, I always go back to that number, which is 5 percent of the world GDP is tech spend. It’s projected to double. I think that doubling will happen in a more accelerated pace. And we feel well-positioned because of the innovation across the stack, because if you think about it, what’s going to happen is every business, whether you’re a retailer or a manufacturer in the service sector, public sector or private sector, digital adoption is the way you’re going to be both resilient, as well as transform the core business processes. And the strength we have is that entirety of the Microsoft cloud stack, right? It’s not just about infrastructure or any application, it’s the entirety of what we do. I think it is durable. Quarter to quarter, depending on what happened during the pandemic, depending on the segments that were impacted, for example, the consumer segments that were impacted are coming back and then they’ll normalize. Whereas in our case we do – in fact, one of the things I love about sort of our exposure is both it’s a worldwide exposure and it has got the right balance between the consumer segments and the enterprise business-to-business segment. It’s a very durable, long-term growth prospect that we have tough competition and we need to keep innovating, which is what we’ll stay focused on. AMY HOOD: And maybe turning to your margin question, and while I am obviously proud of the work we’ve done, Keith, that you referenced, as a team on margins and returns, I would say in general our focus remains and has been for the duration of really Satya and I’s work together, along with the rest of the SLT, on consistently moving our resources and talent to our highest growth and most differentiated places. When you do that in expansive, total addressable markets in the way that I believe we’re focused on as an organization, you do see the type of operating leverage that you’re referring to and margins. And that, along as you see sort of mathematically with a shift in our revenue to higher overall gross margin segments, you do get the results we’ve seen. I feel very good about the work we’ve done. And as you heard, I’m quite optimistic about the opportunities we have to invest leading into FY22 as well. KEITH WEISS: Excellent. Thank you so much, guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you very much for taking the question. And again, also, congrats on the quarter. And Amy, thanks for the details and color, especially in the guidance. I want to ask about seasonality in Azure. Traditionally, we’ve seen seasonality in the Azure numbers in Q4. And obviously last year, we didn’t see it because of COVID, but we also didn’t see it this year. Has something changed that has changed the seasonality of the business and does that continue going forward? And then as a follow up question, Keith asked about op-ex efficiency overall, but I’d like to ask specifically on the cloud. Is there any reason that the cloud op-ex shouldn’t continue to grow slower than revenue, obviously on an annual basis, not a quarterly basis. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Mark, for the question. Let me cover your first one, which is the seasonality in the Azure business. In some ways, Mark, some of that seasonality, frankly, was because Azure has two fundamental components. It’s got a consumption model, as well as a per user model. The per user model, which, as you well know, is far more aligned to our sort of end of year and can be more aligned to our end of year rhythms, it also can have more quarterly volatility in terms of accounting, in terms of revenue recognition, the same topic we often talk about when it comes to Microsoft 365 in terms of more in-quarter recognition. What you’ve seen is that did historically represent a larger component of Azure, so added volatility to Q4. As we’ve seen our consumption businesses grow and grow consistently, and thus far becoming a larger percentage of Azure, you do have more stability, Mark, and so you start seeing less of that volatility that we’ve historically seen from Q3 to Q4. We still have some of it, as we talked about, but I think it’s an interesting observation and it’s a very good question. In terms of your comment on cloud revenue and op-ex, yes, I do believe that’s durable. We get a lot of focus. We’ll continue to invest. There’s lots of opportunity there. But the market certainly warrants it. MARK MOERDLER: Makes sense, and I appreciate all the detail. Thank you very much. Congrats. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Amy, a lot of questions on margins. I’m curious if you think there is a ceiling in the near term on margins or do you feel that you’ve got an elevated flight level, if you will, and we shouldn’t have to be worrying about that level of margin. Can you just give us any more color as it relates to how you’re thinking about that? Thank you. AMY HOOD: Well, I think for FY22 on operating margins, which is really where I focus most of my thoughts, as I said, when you exclude the useful life change, I feel very good about margin improvement in FY22. But what sits behind that, Brent, is this focus on the first thing I said, which is with every operating expense dollar we invest, are we continuing to invest it in the highest growth places? If you continue to invest in high growth places with differentiation that customers care about and you add value, you continue to see improvements in this area. From time to time, I’m sure there will be quarters where that isn’t the case if we have some mix shift in the hardware, et cetera, but in general, over a longer period of time, you’ve seen us focus on this. And so if you remove a little of the noise of some of the useful life changes and look back a few years, I do think you’d see the biggest needle mover being where we invest the dollars as opposed to the overall amount of them, which should grow based on the opportunity. BRENT THILL: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks very much. Amy, thank you for giving more formal Azure guidance for the next quarter. That’s very helpful. If Azure is going to remain stable in constant currency, I guess at 45 percent, and you had indicated that EMS growth should moderate, effectively you’re saying that the consumption piece of Azure might accelerate in the September quarter. I’m wondering if you could unpack that a little bit. Is this as simple as prior period commitments ramping at an accelerated pace? Love to hear your thoughts. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. I think in general, you’ve got the right trajectory, and I do think it’s both things. You’ve heard me say it’s both some of our core, as well as premium SKUs. We’ve seen some nice execution. And I think Satya mentioned some of these differentiated places in the Azure stack where I think we also can see some growth. Data services is a very good point where I feel like we’ve made a lot of progress, have a real differentiation, and have seen some acceleration in the past couple of quarters. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Got it. Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Karl. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MURPHY, JPMorgan: Thank you very much. Satya, at the Ignite conference a few months ago, you commented that cloud architectures have reached peak centralization. I’m wondering what developments are you seeing that inform your viewpoint. And Amy, do you sense uplift in some of those intelligent edge products, such as Azure Stack or others, contributing to the improvement in server product growth that we saw this quarter? SATYA NADELLA: Thanks so much for that question. A couple of things that are happening. One is that all up even what we consider the cloud infrastructure is getting increasingly distributed. If you think about the approach we took to our data center architecture, the fact that we have more regions, is to me, I would say, both the real world needs for the computing architecture side, but also the regulatory and data residency requirements. We feel we picked the right approach and that’s paying dividends today just even in terms of our geographic coverage, our coverage of all of the regulatory requirements. Then the second piece, of course, is distributed computing will remain distributed. And what we’re seeing with edge is going to be the case where we will see more of both the old workloads with hybrid benefits and hybrid deployments, as well as new workloads. If you take the AB InBev digital twin meets IoT type of scenario, that’s going to require a lot more compute close to their factories. And so to me, those new scenarios, or 5G, I mean, think about what AT&T is planning to do, which is hybrid deployment in a completely new space where there is going to be compute that’s located to be able to take core network traffic and use cloud economics. That’s what we think of going forward, which is really compute will remain distributed, both because of the needs across geographies, regulation, and the very nature of computer architecture. AMY HOOD: And to the question you asked on how to think about the edge and where to see that in results, really it shows up, this is one where I would focus on the overall server products and cloud services number, which I think, Mark, was at the heart of your question, because through our purchasing vehicles, the most effective way to purchase for flexibility with and across the edge and the cloud is sometimes some of the on-prem licensing with hybrid rights. You do see that both in our Azure results, but also depending on how it’s purchased, in server KPI. MARK MURPHY: Thank you very much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT BRACELIN, Piper Sandler: Good afternoon and thanks for taking the call. A question for you really around $10 million-plus contracts. You called out momentum this quarter and last quarter. My question is around the drivers of these larger enterprise commitments. Is this driven by just the larger scope of deals or are you seeing kind of broader attach rate across the whole breadth of Microsoft products? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Brent. Maybe, Satya, I’ll take this one first, and if you want to add anything. Brent, unfortunately I’m going to answer, it’s everything. And let me talk about why I say that. When you see the size of the contracts increase, it’s about the entire scope of what’s offered under the Microsoft cloud. We’re seeing both really strong renewals of our core contracts, really strong additions across Dynamics, Power Apps, Power Automate, M365, Premium SKUs, security, compliance, voice, which of course increases those commitment sizes. And you’re seeing the addition of Azure commitments, which we often talk about as these multiyear longer term contracts. And so then you do, of course, see them just have longer duration, especially in the case of Azure. In many ways, what we focus on are the components that make up the larger contracts, is each component being additive to selling the value that’s present across all of our pieces of the Microsoft cloud? This was a good execution quarter for us. You see it in the bookings number even more. When you have a declining expiry base and then bookings growth that’s that high, you have to do all those things well. And that’s, I think, really what’s reflected ultimately and transactionally meaning those larger $10 million-plus contracts being done. BRENT BRACELIN: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) ALEX ZUKIN, Wolfe Research: Hey, guys, thanks for taking the question. I guess my main question, maybe for Satya, you’ve noted the future of work having changed and you talked about the fusion of Teams into both the application stack, the operating system stack, and really amongst the entire Microsoft portfolio. Is that driving, given the acceleration you’re seeing in Dynamics, can you talk to the fact, is that driving larger deals, new bites of the apple, or how is that changing the landscape? And how do you think about that versus what your competitors are doing? SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, that’s a great question, thanks for that. Multiple things happening and both some of them are independent, secular growth trends, and they do reinforce each other. Let’s just take Dynamics. It’s probably one of the most exciting things we’re seeing is that coming out of this pandemic, there is an absolute new chapter for a complete new suite, all the way from whether it’s sales to customer service to marketing to supply chain or digital manufacturing that’s all going to be reimplemented. There’s going to be a complete new cycle of business process automation that is going to be AI first and collaboration first. And that second part is where that intersection between Teams and business process or Dynamics comes through, because you do not want to have a system of record for anything, whether it is a customer or a part or a forecast that you don’t want to collaborate on, that you don’t want to communicate on. And by the way, the communications and the collaboration artifacts are part of the record. And that’s what I think that this new generation of software will enable. You see it in two fronts. One is Teams has become a platform not just for Dynamics, even for Salesforce, for SAP, for Adobe, for ServiceNow. They’re all building great integrations into Teams and we’ll foster that. And Dynamics itself, of course, will integrate deeply with Teams and embed Teams or Azure Communication Services. So when you think about our omnichannel customer service module, it doesn’t look like anything from two years ago. It’s a completely rebuilt omnichannel customer service system, which has all the communication functionality built in. It’s a pretty exciting space and it also speaks to a lot of the questions around where’s the margin, how is it going to sort of evolve? I think tracking what’s happening with Power Platform, Dynamics, and Teams, I think probably, and its intersection to even some of our data layers in Azure is perhaps the best indication of some of our competitive differentiation at scale already. ALEX ZUKIN: Perfect. Thank you guys so much. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Alex. Operator, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) KEITH BACHMAN, Bank of Montreal: Hi. Many thanks for taking the question. Amy, I wanted to direct this to you and go back to margins for a second. Is there any comments or color that you could provide? I know you said you focus on the operating margin side, but on the trends you anticipate this year in ‘22 around gross margins, with or without the depreciation schedules. Part B is, on the last quarter call, you indicated that operating expenses might grow kind of mid-teens, or low teens, I should say, in ‘22. I was wondering if you would want to update the comments on how we should be thinking about operating expense trends as we look at FY22. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Keith. When I think about your operating expense comments, no, I don’t have any update to that. I think if you think about our headcount growth at 12 percent plus through the year, continuing to invest in some of the places where we saw savings for the year on COVID, I would expect that that is still a good placeholder for people as we work through the year. I mean, with the opportunity we see in the market, I think it supports that level. And given our execution when we do invest, which leads me to margin, I feel very good about that. At the gross margin level, we’ll continue to focus really on the same things we’ve always focused on, which is continuing across our cloud services to see improving margins. You’ll continue to see a mix shift to Azure, given the growth we expect there, and we’ll continue to see gross margin improvements across individual services that make up many of our components across the company. In general, I feel like the gross margin trends are quite healthy heading into ‘22. KEITH BACHMAN: Okay, great. Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you, everyone. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you. (Operator Direction.) END"

We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Brett. It was a record quarter, powered by our continued strength of our commercial cloud. Over a year into the pandemic, digital adoption curves aren’t slowing down. In fact, they’re accelerating, and it's just the beginning. Digital technology will be the foundation for resilience and growth over the next decade. We are innovating and building the cloud stack to accelerate the digital capability of every organization on the planet. Now, I’ll highlight our growing opportunity and momentum, starting with Azure. As the world’s COGS become more digital, computing will become more ubiquitous and decentralized. We are building Azure to address organizations’ needs in a multi-cloud, multi-edge world. We have more datacenter regions than any other provider, including new regions in China, Indonesia, Malaysia, as well as the United States. Azure has always been hybrid by design, and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Arc extends the Azure control plane across on-premises, multi-cloud, and the edge, and we’re going further with Arc-enabled machine learning and Arc-enabled Kubernetes. Companies like Fujitsu and KPMG are using Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure data services anywhere. Our differentiation across the cloud and the edge is driving deeper and more strategic partnerships with leading companies in every industry – from Total and Repsol in energy, to Kaiser Permanente in healthcare, and Amadeus in travel. Now, to data and analytics. Core to the competitiveness of every company going forward will be their ability to turn data into predictive and analytical power. The next generation analytics service, Azure Synapse, accelerates time to insight by bringing together data integration, enterprise data warehousing, and big data analytics into one unified service. No other provider offers the limitless scale, price-performance, and deep integrations of Synapse. With Spark integration, for example, organizations can handle large-scale data processing workloads. With Azure Machine Learning, they can build advanced AI models. With Power BI, anyone in the organization can access insights. We are seeing adoption from thousands of customers, including AB InBev, Dentsu, and Swiss Re. Queries performed using Synapse have increased 105 percent over the last quarter alone. We are leading in hyperscale SQL and non-SQL databases to support the increasing volume, variety, and velocity of data. Customers continue to choose Azure for their relational database workloads, with SQL Server on Azure VMs use up 129 percent year over year. And Cosmos DB is the database of choice for cloud-native app development – at any scale. Transaction volume increased 170 percent year over year. Now on to developers. As every organization looks to build its own digital capability, they will need to modernize existing apps, build new apps, and have a standard way of doing both. We offer the most popular tools to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. Visual Studio has more than 25 million monthly active users, and GitHub is home to nearly 65 million developers. Over the past 12 months, the number of monthly active organizations using GitHub increased 70 percent. In fact, some of the most groundbreaking technological achievements of the past year – including critical COVID-19 vaccine trials, as well as the first powered flight on Mars – were only possible because of the contributions of open source communities on GitHub. At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers infuse AI into the solutions they build. Large-scale AI models are becoming platforms, and we’ve seen dramatic advances in research and deployment by Open AI, whose models are trained and hosted exclusively on Azure. GPT-3 is generating 4.5 billion words per day on average, with hundreds of apps in production across a range of industries. With Azure Cognitive Services, organizations can build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making. New capabilities enable developers to add semantic search to their apps and help companies like AT&T, Duolingo, and Progressive build custom neural voices for their products. And we’re going further with Azure Percept, a complete platform – from silicon to service – which simplifies the process of developing, training, and deploying AI at the edge. As the virtual and physical worlds converge, the metaverse – comprised of digital twins, simulated environments, and mixed reality – is emerging as a first-class platform. We are leading and seeing traction across the public and private sector. Bentley Systems is building a digital twin of the city of Dublin to reimagine urban planning, using Azure Digital Twins and Azure IoT. PepsiCo is simulating its manufacturing processes to improve product consistency, using our autonomous systems platform. And, from Airbus and Toyota, to L’Oreal and Intel, customers in every industry are transcending space and addressing complex challenges, using mixed reality. The U.S. Army, for example, will use a HoloLens-based headset, augmented with our cloud services. New Microsoft Mesh builds on this momentum, allowing for holographic interactions with true presence in a natural way – on any device. We’ve already seen early adoption by Accenture, which is using Mesh to build immersive virtual office experiences. Power Platform is becoming the next generation business process automation and productivity suite for domain experts in all functions. We have taken a unique approach to what is an expansive and high-growth TAM, bringing together robotic process automation, low-code/no-code tools, virtual agents, and business intelligence. Using Power Platform, any domain expert can automate a workflow, create an app, build a virtual agent, or analyze data, rapidly driving productivity gains across the organization through smart automation. Just like Office revolutionized productivity gains for knowledge workers, Power Platform will do the same for domain experts. All-up, Power Platform is being used by nearly 16 million monthly active users, up 97 percent year over year. Revenue increased 84 percent year over year. Telstra, T-Mobile, Toyota North America, and Unilever have all built centers of excellence for Power Platform, with thousands of workers who are using our low-code/no-code tools to build apps and workflows for everything from COVID-19 screening to product quality control. In robotic process automation, Coca-Cola saved months of development time by integrating Power Automate with legacy systems to automate shipment verification, payroll processing, and more. And in analytics, Daimler chose Power BI to surface insights across the organization, while maintaining the highest levels of security. Now on to Business Applications. Dynamics 365 had a breakthrough quarter, as companies turn to intelligent business applications to adapt and grow. Revenue increased 45 percent, as we continue to take share from competition. We’re adding capabilities across Dynamics 365 to address organizations’ most pressing challenges. New integrations with Teams make it simple to meet, chat, call, and collaborate directly within Dynamics 365. And new Dynamics 365 Intelligent Order Management helps companies support omnichannel fulfillment. We are seeing increased adoption of Dynamics 365 across every industry, from ABN AMRO in financial services to BMW in automotive. More broadly, across the Microsoft Cloud, we are leading with industry and cross-industry solutions and expanding our investments to help organizations use our complete tech stack, along with industry-specific customizations, to improve time to value, increase agility, and lower costs. This quarter, we introduced new industry clouds for financial services, manufacturing, and non-profits, building on the momentum of our existing clouds for healthcare and retail. And our pending acquisition of Nuance will bring our solutions directly into the physician-patient loop, which is central to healthcare delivery. Now on to LinkedIn. We once again saw record engagement, as LinkedIn’s 756 million members use the network to connect, learn, create content, and find jobs. Conversations increased 43 percent. Content shared was up 29 percent. And hours on LinkedIn Learning increased 80 percent. We’re helping creators use LinkedIn to expand their economic opportunity. Thousands of expert instructors are monetizing their content on LinkedIn Learning. Freelancers can now attract clients with dedicated pages. And, with Creator mode, members can build a following and engage communities. In a world facing a growing skills gap, we are helping employers create feedback loops between skills, learning, credentials, and jobs. 60 percent of the Fortune 500 use LinkedIn Learning to skill and upskill their employees. Nationwide Insurance, for example, is using LinkedIn Learning to provide personalized curriculum to 26,000 associates. And new tools bring together courses with Skills Assessments, helping companies, like BlackRock, Gap, and TaskRabbit, source job candidates based on proven proficiencies. Businesses continue to turn to LinkedIn as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions revenue was up more than 60 percent year over year. Over the past 12 months, revenue has surpassed $3 billion and is growing nearly three times faster than the B2B digital advertising market. Now on to Microsoft 365 and Teams. Hybrid work will require a new operating model. That’s why we built Teams as the organizing layer for all the ways people work, learn, and collaborate. Teams now has over 145 million daily active users, almost double the number a year ago. In markets where employees have returned to the workplace, including Australia, China, New Zealand, South Korea, and Taiwan, we have seen usage continue to grow. And the number of organizations with more than 1,000 users integrating their third-party and LOB apps with Teams has increased nearly 3X year over year. We are accelerating our innovation, adding over 300 features over the past year, including more than 100 new capabilities so far in 2021. New inclusive meeting experiences for hybrid work, including custom gallery views, enable anyone to be seen, heard, and participate – whether they are at home, in a meeting room, at an office, or on a factory floor. And customers like GM and Sanofi are using Teams for unified communications, including for voice. Teams is extending beyond communications, creating an entirely new category of modern collaborative applications, as organizations use Power Platform to build custom apps, bots, and workflows within Teams. American Airlines, for example, highlighted in their earnings call the cost savings it’s driving by using a Power App within Teams to help its frontline workers manage critical gate operations. Teams is transforming not only internal collaboration but how companies do business. We added support for shared workspaces with people outside the organization, and we’re seeing Teams used for everything from virtual retail showrooms and personal shopping to interactive webinars. We introduced Microsoft Viva this quarter, creating a new market category for employee experience. Viva brings together knowledge, learning, communications, and insights in an integrated experience directly within Teams and Microsoft 365. Companies like Coca-Cola and Unilever will use Viva to help their employees thrive in a new era of hybrid work. All-up, Microsoft 365 users generated more than 38 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Office 365 now has nearly 300 million paid seats. And organizations across the private and public sector, like the City of Helsinki, Bausch Health, and Stryker, are increasingly choosing our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics. People are turning to Windows PCs more than ever to stay connected, productive, and secure. Windows 10 now has more than 1.3 billion monthly active devices. And Microsoft 365 Consumer surpassed 50 million subscribers for the first time. Now on to security. The threat landscape has never been more complex or challenging, and security has never been more critical to our customers. This is driving increased demand for our end-to-end capabilities across identity, security, compliance, and management, backed by cloud-scale AI and human expertise, encompassing all clouds and all platforms. What differentiates us and drives customer value is the interconnection between identity, endpoint, apps, cloud, data, and infrastructure, across our cloud-native XDR and SIEM, all informed by our operational security posture, which analyzes more than 8 trillion signals each day. Our approach enables organizations to adopt a Zero Trust architecture, while also reducing the complexity, cost, and risk created by stitching together point solutions. That’s why more than 400,000 customers use our offerings, including many of the world’s most established firms – like Boston Consulting Group, HCA Healthcare, Lowes, and UBS. And Signal is using Azure Confidential Computing to protect data in use for its millions of customers. We’re going further to help protect organizations. We are delivering on our ambition to eliminate passwords, introducing password-less sign-in to Azure AD. Our Azure AD paid customer base has more than doubled year over year to over 300,000. New capabilities in Microsoft 365 Defender help organizations better understand, prevent, and mitigate active threats. Defender has blocked 30 billion threats on email and nearly 7 billion on endpoints over the past 12 months alone. And our compliance manager now offers more than 300 out of the box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. Now on to gaming. We are expanding our opportunity as we help both gamers and creators play, connect, and build, across communities, on any device. People are turning to Xbox more than ever to play and chat with friends, and we saw record engagement this quarter, led by strength on and off-console. With Game Pass, we are redefining how games are distributed, played, and viewed. Just last week, we added cloud gaming via the browser, expanding our reach across PC and mobile. Content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and upon closing our acquisition of ZeniMax Media this quarter, we made 20 of the world’s most iconic and beloved games accessible via Game Pass, with more to come. As games evolve into metaverse economies, we are building new tools to help anyone sell creations on our platforms. Minecraft had nearly 140 million monthly active users, up 30 percent year over year, making it one of the leading platforms in the creator economy. Creators have generated over $350 million from more than one billion downloads of mods, add-ons, and other experiences in Minecraft. This is not including activity outside our own marketplace. We’re also seeing a vibrant marketplace emerge in Flight Simulator, with partners now able to sell content directly within the game. In closing, we are innovating across the entire tech stack, as we differentiate and lead in areas that will be critical to the success of every customer going forward. I’m optimistic about our opportunity ahead. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. And I look forward to rejoining you after for questions. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. My comments today reflect the impact of the ZeniMax acquisition for approximately 3 weeks this quarter as well as in our outlook. There is no impact from the Nuance acquisition that is expected to close by the end of the calendar year. Our third quarter revenue was $41.7 billion, up 19 percent and 16 percent in constant currency. And earnings per share was $1.95 and increased 39 percent and 34 percent in constant currency when adjusted for the tax benefit related to the recent India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. Many trends across industries, customer segments, and geographical markets continued to improve, which coupled with strong execution by our sales and partner teams, drove another quarter of double-digit top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business, accelerating digital transformation enabled by our unique Microsoft cloud value drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings. Strong Azure consumption, increased platform commitments, and higher usage of Teams, Power Platform, and our security offerings were key beneficiaries. Within our small and medium business customer segment, continued improvement in cloud purchasing trends more than offset transactional licensing weakness. And in LinkedIn’s Talent Solutions business, annual contracts and job postings improved with the job market. In our consumer business, Windows OEM and Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions benefitted from a much stronger-than-expected PC market, despite significant ongoing constraints in the supply chain. Improvement in the advertising market again benefitted our Search and LinkedIn businesses. And in Gaming, we continued to see record engagement and strong monetization across our platform, as well as demand that significantly exceeded supply for our Xbox Series X and S consoles. Moving to our overall results. Commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 39 percent and 38 percent in constant currency, on a growing expiration base and low prior year comparable. Growth was driven by consistent execution across our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of larger, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 31 percent and 32 percent in constant currency to $117 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within, and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 2 points year-over-year to 94 percent. Commercial cloud revenue, also better than expected, grew 33 percent and 29 percent in constant currency to $17.7 billion. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 3 points year-over-year to 70 percent driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly with improvement in Azure gross margin mostly offset by sales mix shift to Azure. With the weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately 3 points, about a point more favorable than anticipated. FX increased COGS and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 19 percent and 16 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 69 percent, relatively unchanged year-over-year, with roughly 1 point of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by strong revenue growth in cloud and Gaming that resulted in sales mix shift. Operating expense increased 5 percent and 3 percent in constant currency, lower than anticipated, primarily driven by investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew again this quarter, up 12 percent year-over-year, reflecting our focused investments across key areas like cloud engineering, sales, and customer deployment. Year-over-year growth in operating expense includes roughly 2 points of impact from continued COVID-related savings. Operating income increased 31 percent and 27 percent in constant currency. And operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 41 percent, including nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and roughly 1 point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $13.6 billion and grew 15 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, primarily driven by Office 365 and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue grew 14 percent and 10 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 22 percent and 19 percent in constant currency, again driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. Demand for our high-value security, compliance, and voice offerings drove strong momentum in E5 again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 15 percent year-over-year to nearly 300 million, with acceleration to the cloud in our small and medium business segment and a recovery in growth in our firstline worker offerings. The accelerated cloud adoption negatively impacted Office commercial licensing, which declined 25 percent and 27 percent in constant currency, below expectations. In Office consumer, revenue grew 5 percent and 2 percent in constant currency, slightly below expectations, primarily due to transactional weakness in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 50.2 million, up 27 percent year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 26 percent and 22 percent in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth accelerating to 45 percent and 40 percent in constant currency, with particular strength in Power Apps and our Finance and Operations offering. LinkedIn revenue increased 25 percent and 23 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Our Marketing Solutions business accelerated again this quarter to 64 percent revenue growth. Segment gross margin dollars increased 15 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with nearly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 4 percent and 2 percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 26 percent and 20 percent in constant currency, including 4 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $15.1 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23 percent and 20 percent in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26 percent and 23 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations. Azure revenue grew 50 percent and 46 percent in constant currency, better than anticipated, driven by continued strength in our consumption-based business. In our per-user business, growth in our enterprise mobility and security installed base accelerated again this quarter, up 30 percent to over 174 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable that benefitted from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premises server business increased 3 percent and was relatively unchanged in constant currency with strong annuity performance driven by continued customer preference for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise Services revenue grew 10 percent and 8 percent in constant currency with better-than-expected performance in Microsoft Consulting Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 27 percent and 24 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage increased 2 points year-over-year, with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 12 percent and 10 percent in constant currency, and operating income grew 41 percent and 36 percent in constant currency, with roughly 7 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 19 percent and 16 percent in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance in Gaming, Windows OEM, and Search. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 10 percent, driven by continued consumer demand. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 44 percent, and OEM Pro revenue declined 2 percent, on a prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 10 percent and 7 percent in constant currency, with a lower-than-expected mix of in-quarter recognition from multi-year agreements. In Surface, revenue grew 12 percent and 7 percent in constant currency, lower than expected, primarily due to execution challenges in the commercial segment. Search revenue ex TAC increased 17 percent and 14 percent in constant currency, benefitting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. And in Gaming, revenue increased 50 percent and 48 percent in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 232 percent and 223 percent in constant currency, driven by our new consoles. Xbox content and services revenue, which now includes ZeniMax, grew 34 percent and 32 percent in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance of first-party titles, particularly Minecraft. Segment gross margin dollars increased 14 percent and 11 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Gaming. Operating expense decreased 3 percent and 4 percent in constant currency, and operating income grew 27 percent and 22 percent in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $6 billion, in line with expectations, driven by ongoing investment to support growing global demand from increased customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for P,P, and E was $5.1 billion. Cash flow from operations was $22.2 billion and increased 27 percent year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections. Free cash flow was $17.1 billion, up 24 percent. Other income and expense was $188 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments. As a reminder, we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio. Our non-GAAP effective tax rate was approximately 14 percent. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now let’s move to the outlook. As a reminder, in Q4, we begin to see growth rates that reflect the first full quarter impact of COVID-19 a year ago – both across revenue and operating expenses. Last year, across Windows OEM, Gaming, and Surface, we saw surges in purchasing and usage that will negatively impact Q4 growth rates. In our Search and LinkedIn businesses, Q4 growth rates will be positively impacted given the advertising and job markets of a year ago. And in our transactional business, the slowdown in purchasing in Office and Server last year will benefit Q4 growth rates, particularly in our small and medium business segment. Next, in our largest quarter of the year, we expect the accelerating trends Satya discussed, our differentiated market position, and continued solid execution to result in another strong quarter. Growth in commercial bookings should again be healthy but impacted by a declining expiry base. As always, an increasing mix of larger, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive quarterly volatility in bookings. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage should increase roughly 4 points year-over-year, with less than 2 points from the change in accounting estimate. As a reminder, the favorable impact continues to lessen over time. Excluding the accounting change, Q4 gross margin percentage will also benefit a bit from investments we made a year ago to support increased usage needs in remote work scenarios. Longer term, commercial cloud gross margin percentage will continue to be impacted by revenue mix shift to Azure, increased usage of our productivity and collaboration solutions, and ongoing strategic investments to support our customers’ success. In capital expenditures, we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company, Productivity and Business Processes, and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 3 points, More Personal Computing revenue and total operating expense growth by approximately 2 points, and COGS growth by approximately 1 point. Next to the segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.80 and $14.05 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with healthy seat growth and upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the high-teens, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, we expect mid to high teens revenue growth, driven by continued momentum in Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions, against the low prior year comparable impacted by the transactional purchasing weakness noted earlier. In LinkedIn, we expect revenue growth in the mid-30 percent range, driven by continued strong engagement on the platform and improvements in the advertising and job markets. And in Dynamics, continued momentum in Dynamics 365 will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $16.2 and $16.45 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And our per-user business should continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum, though we expect some moderation in growth rates given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth in the mid-single digits, driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings against a low prior year comparable in transactional purchasing noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.6 and $14 billion. In Windows, overall revenue should grow mid-single digits, driven by Windows commercial products and cloud services growth and continued demand for PCs, partially offset by ongoing supply chain impacts and the comparable noted earlier. In Surface, on a strong prior year comparable, we expect revenue to decline in the mid-teens as we work through the supply chain and execution challenges noted earlier. In Search ex-TAC, we expect revenue growth in the mid-40s, driven by improvements in the advertising market. In Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the mid-to-high single digits. Significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S will continue to be constrained by supply. And on the strong prior year comparable, we expect Xbox content and services revenue to decline in the mid-to-high single digits. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.7 to $13.9 billion and operating expense of $13.1 to $13.2 billion. As a reminder, in operating expense in Q4, we will benefit from continued COVID-related savings, as well as the prior year comparable, which included roughly 4 points of impact from a $450 million charge related to the re-alignment of our retail stores strategy. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q4 effective tax rate to be approximately 16 percent. Now I’d like to share some closing thoughts as we look to next fiscal year. Overall, we have performed well thru three quarters of our fiscal year in a challenging environment, and we fully expect a strong Q4 to lay the foundation for FY22. We will, of course, continue to focus on delivering strong revenue growth in the short-term, but even more importantly, this year has reinforced the critical importance of investing boldly to capture the significant list of opportunities ahead of us. Excellence in daily execution coupled with a thoughtful vision for the future that creates value as well as opportunity for our customers globally will lead to long-term revenue and profit growth. With that, Brett, let’s go to Q&A. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat the instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, and great quarter. I guess this is a question both for Satya and Amy. We’re seeing these really great commercial bookings result come through 39% growth in the current quarter. And Satya, you’ve been talking to us a lot about these more strategic deals and the acceleration of digital transformation. Can you give us a little bit of color of what comes in these more strategic deals? How does it change the dynamics of what types of solutions people are using from Microsoft, the scope of sort of how deeply you’re getting into these customers, and sort of how much of the IT budget you’re getting? And then maybe talk just a little bit about the timeframe for which this comes into revenues. What should our expectation be, when you get one of these big strategic deals? How long does it take to really ramp up this customer onto the broader Microsoft? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Keith, for the question. I think we feel very good both, I would say, of consumption and usage today, as well as, as you mentioned, the bookings, because both of those, at any given point in time, is what we look at. The overall approach to the Microsoft Cloud, if you look at the breadth of what a customer may be doing with us, they may be doing hybrid cloud infrastructure with us. They may be, for the first time, doing tier one workloads on the cloud with us, right, whether it’s in core financials or in retail or in healthcare. Also, they could be deploying the centers of excellence around Power Platform. And Power Platform sits at the intersection of pretty much Dynamics, Azure and Teams, for example. And of course, we’re seeing the growth of Teams. And Teams, as I’ve always maintained, is not just about one thing. It’s not about just meetings or it’s not about just chat, but most importantly, it’s a platform that drives, in fact, line of business and business application termination inside of a collaboration workflow. That’s what we’re seeing. And then, the other thing I would say that we are now seeing is also that industry level differentiation of the all-up Microsoft Cloud. Whether it’s in retail, whether it’s in healthcare or in financial services, we feel that we now can bring the power of the entire cloud together in a much more strategic way. AMY HOOD: And maybe just to build on what Satya was saying, Keith, if you think about bookings or the remaining performance obligation, what I tend to think of is when you hear those words, I think often, we pivot toward these Azure contracts we talk a lot about because they create some volatility. But really, the foundation for these long-term strategic contracts is the Microsoft Cloud, holistically. What you’ll see is not just Office 365, but the suite of Microsoft 365. You’ll see higher level editions of security or compliance workloads. You’ll see Dynamics 365 as a pillar with Power Platform because they’re spanning end-to-end industry solutions, to combine it back to what Satya you’re saying. You see it add a good bookings number, which is fundamentally about do you renew what’s up for renewal, do you add workloads, do you add users, and does it have a component of an azure commitment. All of those things together or what creates this change. And if you look at remaining performance obligation, you see a good bit of it that’s going to be recognized in the next 12 months, and another equally balanced portion that’s beyond that. It’s not all long term. This transition happens quickly. Usage builds. It’s both per user. It’s also per workload and it’s consumptive based. It’s really a more holistic view that I would have people take, as opposed to thinking about an Azure contract as long dated. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Thanks, you guys. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Keith. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thanks, Satya. On healthcare, if you could just frame your aspirations, long term, where you’d like to be in this industry, and if you could just comment on where you still think the lowest hanging fruit is, as it relates to the opportunity sets, specifically building on the Nuance acquisition. SATYA NADELLA: Sure, Brent. Thanks for the question. When I look at the industry cloud opportunities, we think of healthcare as a very critical opportunity for us and a huge and expansive addressable market. If you think about it as a percentage of GDP, obviously, healthcare is significant. And fundamentally, when I think about the provider market in particular, digital tech is going to play a huge role for every provider to do the things that they care the most about, which is improve the patient outcomes, and reduce costs, and reduce the burden on the physicians. That’s where the Nuance acquisition is a great fit for us. We’ve been partnered with them. It also enhances our platform approach, Brent. What we have always done is gone into an industry with a platform and an ecosystem approach. For example, with Nuance, they’ve done a fantastic job of taking what’s perhaps the most defining technology of our times, which is AI, and applying it to healthcare, which is the most important application space. And they’ve done that, again, by really partnering, partnering deeply with EMR systems and the rest of the healthcare ecosystem, ultimately to benefit the providers. We’re really looking forward to that acquisition closing, and we’re already partnered with them in our cloud. But this allows us to take that and integrate more deeply with what we are doing with Teams and some of our AI capabilities even more deeply. And we think we can add a significant amount of value both to our partners in the healthcare ecosystem, as well as, most importantly, to the providers. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Brent. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you very much and again, congratulations on the quarter and how well the company is executing. I’d like to change gears a little bit and drill in a bit on the Dynamics 365 business. Frankly, were this part of any other company or even a standalone business, it would be such a center of enthusiasm by investors, given how fast it’s grown. Satya, when you said Dynamics 365 is taking share from competitors, are you talking about ERP or CRM or is it both or is it something different? And what are the key drivers of that strength and growth, and how sustainable do you believe that is? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks so much for the question, Mark. First of all, we’re very, very excited about what’s happening again with Dynamics 365. And when you asked where is the share coming and where is the growth coming, it’s coming from all those categories. But the most interesting thing is, as somebody wants to deploy even an omnichannel solution, for example, in the world where what’s physical and what is digital need to come together unlike anything before, because the pandemic is bringing about such structural change, you need both that federated inventory management, distributed inventory management system I referenced in my remarks, and you need the customer insights product that is probably one of the fastest growing modules, which is that 360 degree view on customers and customer engagement, and then including the supply chain. Bottom line is that basically, every customer is looking to digitize and bring together the data silos. In fact, silos of CRM and ERP systems. And that’s probably one of the most interesting things we’ve observed, is it’s not about replacing even an existing ERP or an existing CRM. It’s about buying Dynamics and helping them bridge, even, some of the disparate CRM and ERP systems they may have. We do see this as a huge opportunity as the world modernizes and puts in a complete next-generation, more proactive versus reactive business systems. And that’s what Dynamics has been architected for. I feel like coming out of this pandemic and the architecture and all the hard work the team has done over the multiple years now positions are very well. MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you, I much appreciate it. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Mark. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thanks. Question for Amy on OpEx. Amy, the OpEx growth has been extraordinarily low the last several quarters. The growth rate looks like it’s going to end up a little bit in the June quarter, but you mentioned the investments or shifting to future quarters. You probably don’t want to give too much on fiscal ‘22, but I’m just wondering whether we should extrapolate that into thinking that OpEx growth and fiscal ‘22 should get back to the pre-COVID levels of +10%. And if you don’t want to be that specific, maybe you could just help us outline some of the variables we should keep in mind as we model that line item, post-COVID recovery in fiscal ‘22. Thank you. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Karl. And I do think in Q4, and it’s why I specifically called out the four points of impact from a year ago, because it does start to get to a more normalized rate in Q4. And I say that because our headcount growth, which I noted earlier, has been 12%. Overall, you would expect OpEx growth to at least marry your headcount growth over any period of time. And we’ve certainly benefited through the year from COVID-related savings. We’ll continue to have that in Q4, and as we get to ‘22, I would expect to see a little less of that as people get back to the workplace at some level and resume some other normal levels of activity. I do think you’re heading in the right direction on that. And listen, I think that type of growth with the type of opportunity we’re seeing, the number of TAM expansive opportunities, really, Satya went through in his comments where we feel like we’ve got a unique position, an opportunity to take share. I feel pretty confident in being able to certainly land that OpEx growth number. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Got it. Thank you, Amy. SATYA NADELLA: I mean, I think, just to add to it, Amy, I hope in all of your models you have new rows. At least when we think about it from even just last year to this year, we are in many more new categories and in those categories with significant differentiation. When we think about OpEx, it’s not about adding OpEx to this stuff that we had in the past. There’s leverage there. In fact, it’s OpEx going into new TAMs. BRETT IVERSEN: Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KIRK MATERNE, Evercore ISI: Yes, thanks very much and congrats on the quarter. Satya, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit more about Viva. I realize it’s early days on that, but just the kind of feedback you’re getting on that product. And how do you see that sort of fitting in? There seem to be some nice adjacencies with Dynamics, with Office 365. I was just kind of curious if you could give us a little bit of a hand on how it’s going and sort of your excitement level about it over the next quarter, next couple of years. Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you so much for the question. It’s very much a great example of what I was saying in terms of creating a new category. When I look back multiple years now, we started talking about Power Platform. And as I said, even in my script today, we now have a full suite of tools that essentially created this next generation business process automation and productivity suite in Power Platform that’s at scale and growing at scale. Similarly, we think of the experience cloud as a distinct cloud opportunity for us. It brings together even today what have been disparate tools, whether it’s the knowledge mining and management systems in an enterprise, connecting it to learning systems, and ultimately, the employee experience and communication systems. And obviously, it has massive adjacencies to what we are doing with Microsoft 365 and Office 365, in particular, Teams. But it also, to your point, connects up with line of business systems, HRM systems and all of the other things we do in Dynamics, as well as other third-party SaaS applications. It’s very early days, and we’ll take the same approach we have taken, whether it’s in security, whether it’s in Power Platform, whether it’s in Dynamics and many other places where you have seen us grow substantial new businesses, essentially, as part of Microsoft Cloud. But we’re very excited about what this opportunity represents. KIRK MATERNE, Evercore ISI: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kirk. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Thank you very much. Congratulations on the quarter. Satya, I know you’ve said that you expect tech, as a percentage of GDP, to track at about 5% or roughly double over the next 10 years or so. How should we think about Microsoft’s share in that context? Is it going to be steady or do you see that expanding? And if it is going to expand, what are the key products and markets that will drive your relative share growth as you outperform tech and as tech outperforms GDP? Thank you so much. SATYA NADELLA: No, thanks, Kash, for the question. I think that, first of all, we are big believers in two things: One is we need to be competitive in each layer, and then the coming together of each led into a cohesive, coherent architecture of the full stack or the Microsoft Cloud creates that differentiation. And that will define what we think is going to be increasing share for us, as tech itself, as a percentage of GDP doubles. If you look at it, whether it’s on the hybrid infrastructure or the multi-cloud, multi-edge world, which I believe is going to be the world 10 years from now, we are very well positioned. We have led in it. We currently lead in it, and we plan to continue that. When it comes to data, when I look at even what we have been able to do with Synapse even in just the last year and what that can do, both at the cloud and on the edge. When it comes to AI, what we are doing with OpenAI and our cognitive services, or what we are doing with Power Platform. Developer SaaS, one of the most exciting things, again, that I believe is the next 10 years is going to be about developers and the digital capability in every enterprise. And we are the leaders there, right, when you think about VS Code, as well as GitHub, and then of course, all of the things that we are doing with Microsoft 365 and Dynamics in the industry. Ultimately, we don’t take anything for granted, but that said, we’re well positioned for what is expansive TAM and with competitive differentiation, both in the individual layers of the stack, as well as the cohesiveness of the stack itself. KASH RANGAN, Goldman Sachs: Got it. Thank you so much. That does sound like a share-gain story. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Kash. Operator, next question, please. (Operator Direction.) GREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Thanks very much for taking the question. Satya, in your prepared remarks, you spoke about an increase in verticalization of Azure. Can we double-click on that a bit more? How much incremental opportunity do you see in industries like financials, like manufacturing? And are there are other vertical that may make sense to more actively pursue, over time, as well? SATYA NADELLA: Thank you for the question. We absolutely think that, ultimately, customers are looking to increase their time to value, lower cost and improve agility. Being able to customize these workflows to come up with industry schemas, because when you think about increased digitization and workflow automation, it does take that next level of schema discussion of what is, perhaps today, not digital inside an industry. Therefore, what we do by stitching together, coming together of even Microsoft 365, Teams, Power Platform with certain workflows, with data inside of Azure, as well as Dynamics, that absolutely improves the ability for any customer in any one of these industries to improve that time to value. Yes, it is going to both help us with adoption rates increase, the speed with which it increases, and it also differentiates us. And we’ll continue to look. And one of the other things that we are doing is this is not just one industry at a time, it’s also the cross-industry workflows. We absolutely believe that we already talk about not just any individual part of our cloud. We talk about only one thing, it’s called the Microsoft Cloud. And now, we’re increasingly talking about Microsoft Cloud by industry and cross-industry. GREGG MOSKOWITZ, Mizuho: Very helpful, thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Gregg. Operator, we have time for one last question. (Operator Direction.) RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I wanted to ask about security and what we see in terms of changes of the industry and how Microsoft is going to fit in there. We’re obviously in the last quarter with kind of a big topic. Can you talk a little bit about what you see in terms of customers realizing the broadband offering from Microsoft and how the cloud is playing a changing role there? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: No, thank you for the question. Obviously, security is a super important topic for every customer, every board, every executive team. And the fundamental approach we have is how do we ensure that every customer has implemented a zero trust architecture, right? That’s the name of the game, which is how can Microsoft, through our participation in the security industry, accelerate essentially the cyber defense of the entire digital sector and beyond? To me, what we have done is taken a pretty unique approach of bringing identity, end point, application infrastructure all together with XDR and SIM, which is cloud native. That’s pretty unique because we really don’t let the seams get in the way. We make sure that any customer who is able to sort of deploy these systems together has more defense in depth, but also the aggregate data to be able to detect and respond to any intrusion, because that’s sort of the key posture. And then, you couple that with our operational security posture, when you’re processing eight trillion events and using that to continuously help our customers, is increasing, to your point, the cloud adoption rate. If you look at some of the challenges, like the hafnium, the cloud was not impacted. And we did sort of a lot of work to make sure that the patches were out, even for servers that were out of support for multiple years. But at the same time, any business that had moved already to the cloud had none of those issues. Therefore, I think we are going to see increased cloud adoption. We’re going to see increased usage of end-to-end security suites, like what we offer, and most importantly, great hygiene and great operational security posture all the time with zero trust architecture. RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you. BRETT IVERSEN: Thanks, Raimo. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you all. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you. (Operator Direction.) END"
MSFT,2021,2,2021-01-26T12:00:00-00:00,"Microsoft FY21 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call Michael Spencer, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, January 26, 2021 MICHAEL SPENCER: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

It was a record quarter, driven by our commercial cloud, which surpassed $16 billion in revenue, up 34 percent year over year. What we are witnessing is the dawn of a second wave of digital transformation sweeping every company and every industry. Digital capability is key to both resilience and growth. It’s no longer enough to just adopt technology. Businesses need to build their own technology to compete and grow. Microsoft is powering this shift with the world’s largest and most comprehensive cloud platform. Now I’ll briefly highlight how we’re innovating across every layer of the modern tech stack, starting with Azure. We’re building Azure as the world's computer to support organizations’ growing cloud needs. We're investing to bring our cloud services to more customers, announcing 7 new datacenter regions in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, and adding support for Top Secret classified workloads in the United States. We have always led in hybrid computing, and we are accelerating our innovation to meet customers where they are. Azure Stack HCI, now broadly available, helps businesses extend the power of the cloud to sovereign workloads. More than 1,000 customers now use Azure Arc to simplify hybrid management and run Azure services across on-premises, multi-cloud, and at the edge. And, with Azure Digital Twins, organizations like Bentley Systems, Honeywell Industries, and Johnson Controls can bridge the digital and physical worlds, creating simulations of factories and cities to optimize their operations. We are seeing momentum in every industry. Deutsche Telekom will rely on Azure to modernize its IT infrastructure. Through a partnership with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, as well as Verily, our cloud will be used to help more researchers analyze biomedical data. Cruise and GM chose Azure as their preferred cloud as they work to make autonomous driving mainstream. And, just last Friday, we announced an expansion of our partnership with SAP to accelerate the adoption of SAP workloads on Azure. In the past six months, we have seen Tier 1 ERP migrations from companies such as Bayer, Carhartt, Coats, and PepsiCo to Azure. At the data layer, Azure is the only cloud with limitless data and analytics capabilities that enable organizations to build the predictive and analytical power required to digitally transform. Azure Synapse brings together big data, data warehousing, and data integration, all into one powerful solution. Leading companies like FedEx, Grab, and P&G are using Synapse to generate immediate insights from massive amounts of structured and unstructured data. And, we are seeing strong overall growth in our analytics business, as companies accelerate their data initiatives to build competitive advantage. Data governance is top of mind for every business leader and will grow into an important category on its own, as critical as any AI or analytics category today. We are investing to participate in this growth. New Azure Purview provides an end-to-end view of an organization’s data estate across on-premises, multi-cloud, and SaaS apps that previously was impossible. In AI, we offer the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks, and infrastructure, enabling businesses to build mission-critical solutions that comprehend speech, understand natural language, make predictions, provide insights, and support decision-making. Our Azure Health Bot, for example, is being used by organizations like the CDC, Premera Blue Cross, and Walgreens to build virtual healthcare assistants used by more than 80 million people worldwide at a time when expanding access to healthcare information is more critical than ever. Now to developers. Developers have been critical to business continuity over the last year, and we’re helping them collaborate and scale their impact to drive organizational outcomes. From GitHub to Visual Studio, we have the most widely used and loved toolchain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. Use of GitHub is becoming key to building digital capability in every company across every industry. Today, GitHub is used by more than 56 million developers, as well as 3 million organizations – from BuzzFeed and Plaid, to Marsh & McLennan, Oracle, and Volvo Car. Now to Power Platform. We are empowering domain experts, enabling anyone in an organization to build applications, automate processes, create virtual agents, and analyze data. Power Platform is the clear leader in low code/no code development, with more than 11 million monthly active users, up 95 percent year over year. Businesses like Nestle and Humana chose Power BI this quarter to help employees use data to make smarter decisions. In public sector, the city of Kobe, in Japan, is relying on Power Virtual Agents and Power Automate to keep citizens informed, building intelligent bots to answer frequently asked questions, as well as automated workflows to route inquiries. Vaccine distribution perhaps best exemplifies the critical need for digital capability across the globe, and our Vaccination Registration and Administration Solution, built on Power Platform, enables governments to manage the end-to-end process, from screening and scheduling, to administration, and follow ups. In Australia, the government of Victoria is relying on our tools to help deliver doses to more than 6 million residents, and here in the United States, Minnesota, Nebraska, and Oklahoma are using our capabilities. Our Return to the Workplace solution in Power Platform is also helping organizations keep workers safe and healthy when they go back to the office. And we’re adding new capabilities to ensure people have verifiable, secure access to their vaccination records. Now to Dynamics 365. We are taking share as companies in every industry turn to new business applications to grow. Customer expectations are changing faster than ever, requiring near real-time visibility into trends, behavior, and needs. Our customer data platform, Customer Insights, leads its category and has helped customers unify over 2 billion customer profiles, providing a single view of interactions across marketing, sales, and e-commerce to deliver more personalized experiences. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to keep frontline employees connected even when they are apart. L’Oréal, for example, is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist and HoloLens 2 to help technicians repair equipment at factories even when they cannot travel. In retail, our applications were front and center at NRF earlier this month. Dynamics 365 Commerce now supports both B2C and B2B e-commerce, enabling retailers like Columbia Sportswear to ship inventory from stores and offer contactless payment options. PromoteIQ continues to scale rapidly, with retailers like DICK’S Sporting Goods, The Home Depot, and Kroger using the platform to power their digital vendor marketing programs. Finally, our new Microsoft Cloud for Retail is bringing together our platforms and tools across the shopper journey, accelerating time to value. It builds on the success of the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare, which is being used by organizations, including Providence, to empower clinicians to better serve patients. Now to LinkedIn. We once again saw record levels of engagement across the platform, as LinkedIn’s nearly 740 million members use the network to connect, learn, and find new opportunities. Sessions increased 30 percent. Conversations were up 48 percent. And hours spent on LinkedIn Learning were up 2X, compared to a year ago. LinkedIn’s advertising business had a record quarter, accounting for more than a third of LinkedIn’s total revenue. LinkedIn Marketing Solutions was up over 50 percent, as advertisers increasingly turn to the platform as the trusted way to reach professionals ready to do business. Finally, we continue to benefit from the secular shift to remote selling. Businesses are using the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely, while new tools help sales organizations use LinkedIn data to identify and size opportunities. Now to Microsoft 365. The pandemic has proven the PC’s central role in keeping people connected, productive, and secure. We added more new devices running Windows 10 this quarter than ever before. At CES, our partners showcased new PCs designed for the new ways we work, learn, and play. And our Pluton security processor, built with AMD, Intel, and Qualcomm, will bring chip-to-cloud security. Flexible work is here to stay. To empower the digital workforce, organizations will need an organizing layer for all the ways people work, learn, and collaborate. That’s what Microsoft 365 and Teams uniquely provide. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration with Office, and business process workflows – in a secure, integrated user experience. We are seeing larger deployments. 117 organizations have more than 100,000 users of Teams, and over 2,700 organizations have over 10,000. And Teams has nearly 60 million daily active users on mobile alone. Teams enables people to collaborate both synchronously and asynchronously, retain business context, and stay in the flow of work – driving increased usage across Office 365 and Power Platform. Power Platform monthly average usage on Teams has grown 4X year-over-year, and with Microsoft Dataverse, anyone can now create and deploy custom solutions with Power Apps and intelligent bots with Power Virtual Agents directly in Teams. Teams is rapidly becoming the de facto unified communications platform of choice for every organization. New features like voice enabled channels create a more powerful and streamlined calling experience, and noise suppression and live captions with speaker attribution make meetings more accessible. At Accenture alone, audio conferencing on Teams has increased to over 1 billion minutes a month, as 85,000 employees use Teams to make external calls. And, this quarter, Lumen, formerly CenturyLink, rolled out Teams calling globally to 42,000 employees in just four weeks. The pandemic has shown the importance of empowering the 2 billion frontline workers around the world with the right technology. 390,000 associates at the Home Depot will use Microsoft 365, including Yammer, to foster connection and engagement across the organization. And more than 500,000 employees at the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, including healthcare workers, use Teams to collaborate. In education, more than 200 million students and educators worldwide rely on Microsoft Education products for remote learning. And leading customers in every industry, including Amgen, AT&T, Daimler, GSK, and IKEA, are increasingly turning to our premium offerings for advanced security, compliance, voice, and analytics capabilities. Microsoft 365 E5 revenue has grown triple digits for the past four quarters. Now to security. The recent SolarWinds attacks are a stark reminder of how critical security is to our customers. We are focused on ensuring organizations deploy and maintain a Zero Trust architecture. Our end-to-end security capabilities, inclusive of identity, security, compliance, and management – across all clouds and all client platforms – have been key as we help customers strengthen their security posture and mitigate impact. Beyond our products, our operational security posture and threat intelligence, which analyzes 8 trillion signals each day, help customers defend themselves. Over the past 12 months, our security business revenue has surpassed $10 billion, up more than 40 percent. This milestone is a testament to the deep trust organizations place in us, and we will continue to invest in new capabilities across all our products and services to protect our customers. We see strong momentum in usage of our products: In identity, Azure AD has more than 425 million monthly active users. In security, Microsoft Defender blocked nearly 6 billion threats last year alone. In management, we saw triple digit growth in the number of devices managed by Microsoft Intune. And, in compliance, we’ve seen a 90 percent increase in our customer base year over year. Now to Gaming. We surpassed $5 billion in revenue for the first time this quarter, as we expand our opportunity to reach the world’s three billion gamers, wherever they play. The launch of the Xbox Series X and Series S was the most successful in our history, with the most devices ever sold in a launch month. Game developers are benefiting too, as they turn to us to reach more players and scale their games using the power of our cloud. We exceeded $2 billion in revenue from third-party titles this quarter for the first time. We are gaining console share, as gamers recognize the value of our broader ecosystem. Xbox Live has more than 100 million monthly active users, while Game Pass now has 18 million subscribers. And, we are transforming how games are distributed, played, and viewed, bringing cloud gaming in Game Pass to iOS devices and Windows PCs over the next few months. We are pleased with the overall growth in our consumer subscriptions. With Game Pass and more than 47 million Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers, we have a large and growing consumer subscription business. And we see significant growth opportunity in both these segments as they move to services and on-demand models. In closing, I’m energized by our increasing momentum, and the expanding opportunity fueled by the structural change brought about by the rapid adoption of digital technology. We are investing to meet these needs in the coming decade, and I’m optimistic about what’s ahead. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining you after for questions. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $43.1 billion, up 17 percent and 15 percent in constant currency. Earnings per share was $2.03, increasing 34 percent and 31 percent in constant currency. Across our business, results exceeded expectations, driven by strong execution and improving trends across industries, customer segments, and geographical markets, resulting in double-digit top and bottom-line growth. In our commercial business, customers prioritized their digital transformation, which drove healthy demand for our hybrid and cloud offerings with material growth in the number of 10 million-dollar-plus Azure and Microsoft 365 contracts. We saw stronger Azure consumption, as well as higher usage of Teams, Power Platform, and our advanced security and compliance offerings. And within our small and medium business customer segment, transactional licensing trends continued to show some improvement. In our consumer business, the overall PC market was stronger than expected, benefiting our Windows OEM, Office consumer, and Surface businesses. The advertising market continued to show improvement, benefiting our Search and LinkedIn businesses. And in Gaming, we saw record engagement and monetization across our platform, as well as console demand that significantly exceeded supply following the Xbox Series X and S launches. Moving to our overall results. Even with a declining expiration base and a strong prior year comparable, commercial bookings increased 19 percent and 11 percent in constant currency. Strong execution across our core annuity sales motions, including the Azure and Microsoft 365 momentum noted earlier, drove the better-than-expected result. Commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24 percent and 22 percent in constant currency to $112 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within, and the portion beyond, the next 12 months. And our annuity mix increased 4 points year-over-year to 93 percent. Commercial cloud revenue was $16.7 billion as growth accelerated to 34 percent and 32 percent in constant currency. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 4 points year-over- year to 71 percent driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly. As a reminder, revenue mix shift to Azure, increased customer usage of our productivity and collaboration solutions, and continued strategic investments to support customer success in the deployment of our solutions will continue to impact gross margin. With the weaker US dollar, FX increased revenue growth by approximately 2 points, about a point more favorable than anticipated. FX had no impact on COGS growth and increased operating expense growth by approximately 1 point, both in line with expectations. Gross margin dollars increased 18 percent and 16 percent in constant currency. Gross margin percentage was 67 percent, up slightly year-over-year, with roughly 2 points from the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down, driven by the sales mix shift to cloud and Gaming. Operating expense increased 3 percent and 2 percent in constant currency, lower than anticipated, driven by greater-than-expected COVID-related savings, reductions in retail store expenses, and investments that shifted to future quarters. Overall, company headcount grew more than 10 percent year-over-year with our focused investment in key areas, such as customer success, cloud engineering, and sales. Operating income increased 29 percent and 26 percent in constant currency. And operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 42 percent, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate and nearly 1 point of favorable impact from COVID-related savings. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $13.4 billion, increasing 13 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by Office commercial and LinkedIn. On a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 3 points of benefit primarily from transactional strength in Japan, Office commercial revenue grew 11 percent and 9 percent in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 21 percent and 20 percent in constant currency. Results were driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU. The strong demand for Microsoft 365 noted earlier, particularly for our security, compliance, and voice components, drove E5 revenue growth acceleration again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15 percent year-over-year, with strong conversion of our free trial offers. We also saw seat growth improvement in our small and medium business and firstline worker offerings. Office consumer revenue grew 7 percent and 6 percent in constant currency on a strong comparable that included roughly 7 points of benefit from transactional strength in Japan. Microsoft 365 consumer subscriptions grew to 47.5 million, up 28 percent year-over-year. Dynamics revenue grew 21 percent and 18 percent in constant currency driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 39 percent and 37 percent in constant currency. The number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads accelerated again this quarter. LinkedIn revenue increased 23 percent and 22 percent in constant currency, significantly ahead of expectations. Growth in our marketing solutions business accelerated to 53 percent, benefiting from the stronger advertising market noted earlier. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage was relatively unchanged year-over-year with roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 4 percent and 3 percent in constant currency, and operating income increased 19 percent and 17 percent in constant currency, including 5 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $14.6 billion, ahead of expectations, increasing 23 percent and 22 percent in constant currency. Server products and cloud services revenue increased 26 percent and 24 percent in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 50 percent and 48 percent in constant currency, driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business that benefited from improvement across industries and customer segments noted earlier. Our per-user results were also better than expected driven by accelerated growth in our enterprise mobility and security installed base, up 29 percent to over 163 million seats. And on a strong prior year comparable that included roughly 4 points of benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008, our on-premises server business increased 4 percent and 3 percent in constant currency with strong annuity performance driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium offerings. Enterprise Services revenue grew 5 percent and 4 percent in constant currency, again driven by Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 29 percent and 27 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year, with roughly 3 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 12 percent and 11 percent in constant currency, and operating income grew 43 percent and 41 percent in constant currency, with roughly 10 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $15.1 billion, increasing 14 percent and 13 percent in constant currency, with better-than-expected performance across all businesses. In Windows, the stronger PC market resulted in overall OEM revenue growth of 1 percent, despite a strong prior year comparable in OEM Pro from the end of support for Windows 7. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 24 percent, and OEM Pro revenue declined 9 percent. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 10 percent and 8 percent in constant currency, driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. In Surface, revenue grew 3 percent and 1 percent in constant currency. Search revenue ex TAC increased 2 percent and 1 percent in constant currency, benefiting from the improved advertising market noted earlier. And in Gaming, revenue increased 51 percent and 50 percent in constant currency. Xbox hardware revenue grew 86 percent, driven by the new console launch, as well as the benefit from lower price promotions on our prior-generation consoles. Xbox content and services revenue grew 40 percent and 38 percent in constant currency, with strong growth in third-party transactions, Game Pass subscribers, and first-party titles. Segment gross margin dollars increased 11 percent and 9 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased 2 points year-over-year, driven by sales mix shift to Gaming. Operating expense decreased 10 percent, and operating income grew 25 percent and 22 percent in constant currency. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.4 billion, up 20 percent year-over-year to support growing global demand and customer usage of our cloud services. Cash paid for P,P, and E was $4.2 billion. Cash flow from operations was $12.5 billion and increased 17 percent year-over-year as strong cloud billings and collections were partially offset by payments related to a tax audit settlement. Free cash flow was $8.3 billion, up 17 percent. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations and free cash flow grew 33 percent and 41 percent, respectively. Other income and expense was $440 million, higher than anticipated, primarily driven by net gains on investments, including mark-to-market gains on our equity portfolio, as well as net gains on foreign currency remeasurement. Our effective tax rate was approximately 16 percent, in line with expectations. And finally, we returned $10 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 18 percent year-over-year. Now let’s move to our outlook. My commentary, for both the next quarter and any remarks for the full year, does not include any impact from the Zenimax acquisition, which we still expect to close by the end of the fiscal year. In our commercial business, consistent execution, focus on customer success, and a compelling solution portfolio in high growth markets should drive another strong quarter. In our consumer business, we expect to see healthy demand for PCs and productivity tools continue, though growth rates will again be impacted by the end of support for Windows 7 last year. In Gaming, we expect continued strong engagement on the Xbox platform and significant demand for the Xbox Series X and S that will still be constrained by supply. And our Search and LinkedIn businesses should benefit from the improving advertising market. In commercial bookings, we have a growing Q3 expiry base and a low prior year comparable, so strong execution across our core annuity sales motions and increased commitment to our cloud platform should drive healthy growth. As a reminder, an increasing mix of large, long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable in their timing, can drive quarterly volatility in the growth rates. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will increase by approximately 3 points year-over-year, again driven by the change in accounting estimate. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by revenue mix shift to Azure and continued investments to support our customers’ success. We expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis to our capital expenditures as we continue to invest to meet growing global demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company revenue, COGS, and operating expense growth by approximately 2 points. Within the segments, FX should increase Productivity and Business Processes revenue growth by approximately 3 points and Intelligent Cloud and More Personal Computing revenue growth by approximately 2 points. Now to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $13.35 and $13.6 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with continued upsell opportunity to E5. In our on-premises business, though we anticipate continued improvement in transactional purchasing trends, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-teens range, consistent with the ongoing customer shift to the cloud. In Office consumer, on a strong prior year comparable, revenue growth should be similar to last quarter with continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue. In LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth in the low-20 percent range. And in Dynamics, continued momentum will drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $14.7 and $14.95 billion. In Azure, revenue will again be driven by strong growth in our consumption-based business. And in our per-user business, we expect continued benefit from Microsoft 365 suite momentum. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue growth to be in the low to mid-single digits driven by continued demand for our hybrid and premium annuity offerings on a strong prior year comparable that included the benefit from the end of support for Windows Server 2008. And in Enterprise Services, revenue growth should be roughly in line with last quarter. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $12.3 and $12.7 billion. In Windows, overall OEM revenue growth should be in the low-single digits on the strong comparable mentioned earlier. Windows commercial products and cloud services growth should be in the low to mid-teens driven by continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions. In Surface, good demand against a low prior year comparable should drive growth in the mid to high-teens range. In Search ex-TAC, growth should be driven by improvements in the advertising market. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth of approximately 40 percent driven by next generation console sales as well as Xbox content and services revenue in the mid-20 percent range. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.1 to $13.3 billion and operating expense of $11.9 to $12 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. We expect our Q3 tax rate to be approximately 15 percent, slightly lower than our full year rate of approximately 16 percent. And finally, for FY21, with our strong performance in the first half of the fiscal year and our outlook for Q3, we expect to deliver another full year of double-digit revenue and operating income growth, as well as healthy operating margin expansion even after excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate and COVID-related savings. In closing, we have executed well in the first half of our fiscal year in a challenging and changing environment. Investments made over quarters, and often years, coupled with focused execution by our teams are the drivers behind a compelling portfolio that is delivering value today for our customers and creating optimism in our roadmap for tomorrow. Satya discussed our unique, comprehensive, and integrated set of products earlier on the call – products and services that span large growth markets – and we will continue to invest broadly and boldly against those significant opportunities ahead of us. With that, Mike, let’s go to Q&A. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, could you please repeat instructions? OPERATOR: Thank you. We’ll now be conducting a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question, please press star one on your telephone keypad. A confirmation tone will indicate your line is in the question queue. You may press star two if you’d like to move your questions from the queue. For participants using speaker equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star keys. One moment, please, while we pull for your questions. Our first question comes from the line of Mark Moerdler with Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you for taking my questions, and Satya and Amy, and the whole team, congratulations on the great quarter. It seems like almost every part of the business beat, there did not seem to be any meaningful impact from COVID or tougher comps. Two parts to the question: One, should we feel that the COVID impact is basically behind you; and two, is the tougher comps or are we now seeing the demand is such that allows you to build on those larger numbers? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Thanks, Mark. Maybe I’ll start, and Amy, you can add to it. I think one of the things that we’re seeing is the COVID impact has put a lot of constraints on all our customers. But the one structural change is the digital technology is becoming critical even for core resilience and business continuity, and to deal with what is going to be a structurally changed customer behavior and expectations. So, as a tech company with that comprehensive, differentiated portfolio all the way from business applications, industrial solutions to infrastructure, I think we benefit from that. And that’s what you saw this quarter. But more importantly for me, Mark, when I look at the next 10 years of what compute and digital technology will do across industries, that’s the opportunity that we’re obviously staying very, very focused on and investing in. AMY HOOD: And Mark, maybe to the second half of your question on being past some tougher comparables, I don’t think we are and it’s why I mentioned a couple of them, most particularly I think the OEM number with the pro-end-of-support in Q3. And we did have another strong end-of-support for the server on-prem number. And so, those are the two for Q3 in particular that I would make sure to call out. MARK MOERDLER: Thank you very much and congratulations again. Stay safe. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brent Thill with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Thank you. As you’re putting up a great accelerating quarter, could you just talk to what you’re seeing in terms of the breadth and maybe the size of the transactions, and anything else that you think is important to highlight why we’re seeing this reacceleration in the business? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Maybe again, I’ll start, and Amy, you can add. I would say, again, with Azure, some of the core differentiation we have when it comes to our hybrid leadership, some of the new data products that are highly differentiated and competitive in the marketplace, as well as the integration with every other layer of our stack, whether it’s the dev layer with Power Platform, or GitHub, or with Teams to Power Apps to Azure DB, the industry solutions we now have in healthcare and in retail are all leading to that time to value, the price differentiation and cost advantage to customers, and most importantly, agility in their ability to build their own digital capability. So, that’s what you see in the acceleration around Azure. But when we think about Microsoft Cloud, we think about all the parts coming together to deliver value and differentiation to our customers. AMY HOOD: And maybe just to add a couple thoughts on the shape, Brent, and to make sure that we’re clear on some of the important drivers there, really the Azure consumption comments are not about size of transactions being signed. And you obviously saw we had a good quarter in bookings, which is far more reflective of future commitment. In quarter, what we saw is really fundamental consumption growth and some reacceleration of growth curve, particularly in maybe industries that had been more hard hit in Q4 and Q1. And so, I would describe it a little bit that way, including, frankly, even some mid-market and some segment based recovery on that front. So, as I look forward, obviously, it’s about what Satya talked about, which is there’s differentiation, there’s usage. There’s looking forward to making sure that we continue to have great bookings numbers. But in the quarter itself, it was usage growth, not the contracting that made a difference. BRENT THILL: Thank you. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Karl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question. KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. Amy, I wanted to ask you about the PBP guide for your third quarter, the March quarter. It was comfortably above where everybody, I think, is modeling. And in particular, I wanted to ask you about Office 365. Of all the businesses, the larger ones in Microsoft, most of the upside in this recent quarter, except perhaps for Office 365, where despite the migration to E5 and despite the free-to-paid seat conversion, we really didn’t see an acceleration in Office 365. I’m wondering if you could perhaps unpack that and describe why and part two to the question is your guide for that segment is so good in the March quarter that one would infer that the Office 365 growth is likely to accelerate in March. I’m wondering if you could confirm whether that’s a reasonable assumption. Thanks so much. AMY HOOD: There’s a couple things, Karl, in the PBP guide, and let me break them down a little bit. As you heard, actually, almost all the components in Q3 have sort of consistent to slightly better execution, right? So, there’s upside that we saw in LinkedIn. There’s upside in Office commercial. There’s upside that’s reflected in the stronger subscription number we saw in consumer, and there’s good execution Dynamics. So for me, it’s a bit more, and then we’ll come back and talk about Microsoft 365 all up in a second, each of those pieces, there’s really consistent performance into Q3, which is good. And so, when you think about Office 365, interestingly, what we’re seeing is a lot of the things we have seen before. But remember, we had a pretty tough comp a year ago in Office commercial. And so, for me, I look and say, gosh, we did great execution. We saw some improving trends in seat growth in the frontline, improving trends in SMB that won’t yet be reflected, of course, in revenue, seeing good trial conversion, which again speaks to forward revenue more than in quarter revenue, given that all subscription. And so, you see better seat growth, good conversion and good E5 selling. So, I actually feel pretty good leaving Q2 and entering Q3 in terms of value that customers are getting out of the subscriptions that they’ve got, and the conversions that we’re seeing in the market. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah. I mean, just one quick thing I would add is when you look at Microsoft 365, I think one of the best things I’ve seen recently is when a customer talked about all the things that they’re using compared to even just last year to now that is new value from Office 365 and the usage depth and increase. That’s, I think, really the real power of that franchise, going forward. And so, I hope, you, as shareholders, look at what’s the depth and breadth of the offering and the usage depth by account, which I think is what at least we are investing and tracking closely. KARL KEIRSTEAD: That’s helpful. Thank you both and congrats on the numbers. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we’ll take that question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, guys, and very nice quarter. Satya, I wanted to dig into one of the topics that you mentioned in your introduction, and that’s kind of Teams working as a framework across all of your solutions and sort of connecting more and more people into the Microsoft framework. I was doing some calls this quarter and asking about a competitor’s acquisition of a Team’s competitor. And a lot of people in the channel talked to me about how Teams was pulling through Dynamic CRM, right, and they understood that acquisition as a defense against that. And I was surprised to hear that, that there would be a linkage between the two. Can you help us, one, kind of understand the how Teams pulls in additional products behind it, number one; and number two, the connection between kind of Teams and how they get a broader base of frontline workers into the story for Microsoft, because I think most people think about Microsoft as, like, an information worker story? But frontline workers is another huge kind of area for you guys to go after. SATYA NADELLA: No, thanks much, Keith, for the question. That is absolutely right, and I think I’ve commented on this earlier as well in our calls, which is we built Teams as essentially this tool that brings together multiple capabilities. It brings together chat, it brings together meetings, collaboration, that is Office collaboration, as well as business processes workflow all into one scaffolding. That’s the biggest breakthrough of Teams. In the past, obviously, we had a suite of tools, but this is the first product more so than Outlook was, even, in terms of being able to integrate communications, collaboration and business process. And that’s what you see when we talked about it, and in my comments, that’s why one of the things I stressed was what was happening with just line of business applications before any SaaS application, ours or others, the reality is the most usage in any enterprise is line of business applications that were built custom by their enterprise and their IT organizations from all the departments, whether it’s HR or finance or operations. That is really one of the bigger drivers of Teams usage as a platform capability, right? So, you brought up firstline. There’s some shift scheduling applications, some inventory counting application that the frontline person is using on a mobile phone with Teams. But the inventory management app was just a Power app built using Power Apps. So, that is what you’re seeing. And then, of course, the integrations into Dynamics, integrations into all SaaS applications, whether it’s Workday or whether it’s SAP or whether it is ServiceNow, and even Salesforce, all of these applications are getting integrated into Teams very rapidly. And so, that’s the power of Teams as a platform capability that we are seeing. And you’re absolutely right that this is no longer about just knowledge workers collaborating. In fact, if anything, it’s about knowledge workers collaborating and enabling frontline workers with more of these to participate with digital tools in the workflow versus being disconnected. KEITH WEISS: Excellent. That’s a fascinating expansion of the story. Thanks for digging in on it with us. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. MARK MURPHY, JP Morgan: Yes, thank you very much, and I’ll add my congrats as well. Amy, do you see a sustainably different post-COVID expense profile for Microsoft as it relates to real estate footprint and T&E levels? And maybe, Satya, you could perhaps comment on this as well. Are you expecting a fuller return to the office and fuller resumption of business travel over time, such that that expense profile wouldn’t look very different? SATYA NADELLA: Maybe I’ll just talk about broadly how I think, both at Microsoft as well as what we are seeing as this return to work, I think the key thing, Mark, we need to think about is there will be more flexibility in terms of time, where they work, even the sites people work, because I think the expectations have changed. We obviously are not going to have the same constraints, going forward. So, I’m not at all assuming that we just remain as is all the time, all the way going forward. But at the same time, there’s no return to January of 2020. So therefore, what I think is key for us is to really maintain flexibility. And that’s why even going back to the conversation around Teams, it’s not like the work only happens in online meetings, right? Work happens before meetings, during meetings, after meetings, and especially in hybrid work. You need that sophisticated set of tools that really track workflow irrespective of who is where. And so, that’s what we are focused on. And in our own policies, we have laid out our policies which give more flexibility. And it will be different by function, different by geography, different in time. So, that’s how we expect it’s actually work to evolve. I don’t know, Amy, if you want to add a little more on the expense side. AMY HOOD: Yeah, I think what I would add is maybe to take a step back from the narrowness, in some ways, of the question, Mark, and expand it to say the overall expense logic that we have, going forward, and in many ways, it’s why I talked about we’ve seen headcount growth of over 10 percent in the past year as we invest in the significant opportunities we see and having customers be successful. And that’s at a time when, frankly, we’re coming upon the anniversary across many parts of the world of where we’ve been working remotely for close to a year. And so, it’s about continuing to invest in those places, looking and learning about the types of flexibility that we’re able to provide our own employees, what travel patterns need to look like. And, of course, we’ll do what it takes to deliver success to customers, which should be the driving force behind how we invest in that segment. And finally, so there’s obviously lots of opportunity for us to continue to be flexible in how we work specifically, which is where Satya talked about. But this is a pretty broad conversation and in many ways, I think, talks to a broader rethink of what productivity means across every industry and every role, which I actually think is a very exciting time, both for Microsoft 365 and lots of the tools we’re developing. MARK MURPHY: Thank you. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Walter Pritchard with Citibank. Please proceed with your question. WALTER PRITCHARD, Citibank: Hi, thank you. Question for Satya in how you’re thinking about the $200 billion enterprise applications market. Your market share in that area is fairly low in aggregate. You’ve got Dynamics that’s performing really well and sounds like is accelerating. Just wondering how you’re looking at that market more broadly as an opportunity for the company. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, we’re very, very focused on what we think is modern business process applications, Walter. The way I look at it is there’s a complete rethink on even if you take the previous conversation around what are the workflows that need to get integrated into a communications tool such that there is real continuity between frontline to knowledge worker to business process. I think that opens up with a ton of opportunity. I mean, take something like even digital twins and the level of automation that one can bring even into manufacturing. So, the combination of an Azure PaaS to SaaS capabilities in Dynamic 365 can be very transformative to digital manufacturing, which is probably going to be one of the bigger trends going forward. Same thing in supply chain. So, it’s a pretty important area for us. Business process and business applications, participation, if you will, will be both on the Azure side, on the data side, on the AI side and the biz apps side, as well as Power Apps. So, it’s not one narrow category, because I think most people, the way you measure business applications and the categories of business applications is pretty narrow. The business process is much broader than that. And so, that’s I think at least what we are building towards. AMY HOOD: And maybe just to add a bit to that, Satya. Just I think for us, one of the exciting part about Dynamics and for shareholders is the expansiveness of that redefinition by industry. And even the terms and categorization today that I find that define biz apps, I think, we’ll see or quite large and will be addressed not just with our Dynamics product portfolio, but partially with our LinkedIn portfolio, with our Power Platform portfolio, with Microsoft 365 as well as Azure. And I think that and thinking about it holistically is why it’s so important for us and why we keep coming back to the commercial cloud as our frame. It’s how customers see the solution. It’s how we sell, and it is how solutions are actually implemented for business process change. MICHAEL SPENCER: Great. Thanks, Walter. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. RAIMO LENSCHOW, Barclays: Thank you, and congrats from me as well. I wanted to talk a little bit about gaming. Obviously, you had a very strong quarter. but we also saw a few months ago the launch of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or the xCloud as we knew it. Can you talk a little bit about some of the early experiences there and the importance that you see emerging for that? Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, maybe I’ll start. Amy, you can add to this. On the xCloud, it’s very early days, but we are very excited about fundamentally the expansion opportunity provides. The service today really allows us to take our catalog and not be limited to any of the traditional endpoints, in particular the console and the PC, and expand beyond that. And so, as you can imagine, that I think from our research perspective is very exciting to us. And the fact that we now have a technology solution to do so, we are in the very early innings of that, while at the same time ensuring that we are doing a fantastic job for all our console gamers and PC gamers is going to be how we’ll approach the value of our subscriptions. RAIMO LENSCHOW: Thank you. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Raimo. Operator, we’ll take the last question, please. OPERATOR: Thank you. Our final question comes from the line of Brad Reback with Stifel. Please proceed with your question. BRAD REBACK, Stifel: Great, thanks very much. Amy, the cash flow in the quarter ex the audit settlement was far ahead of everyone’s expectations, and I know you talked about billings in the quarter. But as we look forward, are there any puts and takes that we should be aware of, or should we just focus on cash flow growing pretty much in line with net income? Thanks. AMY HOOD: Yeah, in general, Brad, it’s a very good question because the things you tend to watch that can move it quarter-to-quarter or things like you mentioned, whether it’s the settlement this quarter, whether it’s for free cash flow, the timing of cash capital expenditures versus on an accrual basis. But overall, it really should move in line with operating income, generally, and really reflect the fundamentals of our business execution. This is something we focused on and I do feel like strong sales, improving margins, particularly in the cloud, have all benefited us on those lines. BRAD REBACK: Great, thanks very much. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look forward to speaking with all of you very soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you all and stay safe. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you very much. OPERATOR: Thank you. This concludes today’s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day. END"
MSFT,2021,1,2020-10-27T12:00:00-00:00,"Microsoft FY21 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call Michael Spencer, Satya Nadella, Amy Hood Tuesday, October 27, 2020 MICHAEL SPENCER: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us today.

These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed in today's earnings press release, in the comments made during this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms 10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Satya. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you, Mike. We are off to a strong start in fiscal 2021, driven by the continued strength of our commercial cloud, which surpassed $15 billion in revenue, up 31 percent year over year. The next decade of economic performance for every business will be defined by the speed of their digital transformation. We are innovating across our full modern tech stack to help customers in every industry improve time to value, increase agility, and reduce costs. Now I’ll highlight examples of our momentum and impact, starting with Azure. We are building Azure as the world’s computer, with more datacenter regions than any other provider, now 66, including new regions in Austria, Brazil, Greece, and Taiwan. We are expanding our hybrid capabilities so that organizations can seamlessly build, manage, and deploy their applications anywhere. With Azure Arc, customers can extend Azure management and deploy Azure data services on-premises, at the edge, or in multi-cloud environments. With Azure SQL Edge, we are bringing the SQL data engine to IoT devices for the first time. And, with Azure Space, we are partnering with SpaceX and SES to bring Azure compute to anywhere on the planet. Leading companies in every industry are taking advantage of this distributed computing fabric to address their biggest challenges. In energy, both BP and Shell rely on our cloud to meet sustainability goals. In consumer goods, PepsiCo will migrate its mission-critical SAP workloads to Azure. And with Azure for Operators, we are expanding our partnerships with companies like AT&T and Telstra, bringing the power of the cloud and the edge to their networks. Just last week, Verizon chose Azure to offer private 5G mobile edge computing to their business customers. When it comes to data, Azure brings together cloud-native limitless data and unmatched analytics. Nearly one million SQL databases have migrated to Azure to date, and we process more than 1.4 trillion customer queries each day. The number of petabyte-scale workloads running on Azure has more than doubled year over year. Azure Synapse redefines cloud analytics by bringing together enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. With Synapse Link, customers can run real-time analytics over their operational data. They can build advanced AI models using Azure Machine Learning to identify trends and predict outcomes. And with Power BI, anyone in an organization can access these insights and build custom dashboards. From Electrolux, GE Aviation, and Rockwell Automation in manufacturing, to Marks & Spencer and Myntra in retail, businesses are choosing Synapse to accelerate time to insight across their organizations. We are also leading in AI and its enterprise applications. Azure Cognitive Services make it easier for organizations – from Airbus to Volkswagen Group – to build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision making. We are going further to meet some of our customers’ biggest challenges today, introducing new capabilities to understand people’s movements in a physical space and detect anomalies in metrics. And our partnership with Open AI brings leading-edge large-scale AI models, such as GPT-3, to Azure. Now to developers. As software developers become critical to value creation in every industry, their productivity is key to business performance. We have the most widely used and loved toolchain to help developers rapidly go from idea to code and code to cloud. With the world’s most popular code editing tools – Visual Studio as well as VS Code – developers are more productive than ever. With GitHub, more than 70 percent of the Fortune 50 build software together. And, with Azure, they have the best in class services to build cloud native apps and modernize existing ones. New code scanning capabilities in GitHub help developers find security vulnerabilities before they reach production. And new integrations between GitHub and Power Apps enable professional developers and domain experts to collaborate. At the PaaS layer, we are innovating to help developers build new applications. New Azure Communication Services enable developers to integrate rich communications APIs into their applications, using the same infrastructure that powers Teams. With Azure Mixed Reality Services, the entire world is an application canvas. Lockheed Martin, for example, is using Azure Mixed Reality and HoloLens to speed up the development of the Orion spacecraft. Now to Power Platform. More than ever, companies need to empower domain experts to increase the rate of digitization across the enterprise. Power Platform is the only low-code/no code solution that enables anyone in an organization to rapidly create an application, build a virtual agent, automate a workflow, or analyze data. Power Platform now has more than 10 million monthly active users at more than 500,000 organizations – from IKEA Sweden to Toyota Motor North America. PayPal, for example, is using Power BI within Teams to expand access to data insights. More than 1,900 organizations have signed up to use the Return to the Workplace solution to help keep employees safe and healthy when they go back to the office. The Los Angeles Unified School District plans to use Power Platform to help keep 700,000 students and educators safe across more than 1,400 schools when they reopen. Now to Dynamics 365. As organizations look to move from being reactive to proactive, they are choosing Dynamics 365. From AEP and Chipotle, to Ingram Micro and Walgreens Boots Alliance, we are seeing strong adoption of our customer data platform, Dynamics 365 Customer Insights. More companies are turning to our mixed reality solutions to keep employees connected with experts even when they are apart. Mercedes Benz USA is using Dynamics 365 Remote Assist to help technicians across its U.S. dealerships service increasingly complex cars faster. And BHP is using the solution to keep employees at mining sites in rural Australia safe. Just yesterday, we announced a partnership with C3.ai and Adobe to bring to market a new class of industry-specific CRM solutions, powered by Dynamics 365. And our first industry-specific cloud – the Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare – will become generally available later this week. It brings together healthcare-specific capabilities from across Dynamics 365, as well as Microsoft 365, Power Platform, and Azure, to help providers like Cleveland Clinic and St. Luke’s Health Network improve patient outcomes. Now to LinkedIn. Amid a rapidly changing work environment, LinkedIn is where more than 722 million professionals go to connect with their communities, learn new skills, and find new opportunities. We saw record levels of engagement again this quarter. We launched our most significant redesign, with a streamlined search and messaging experience, as well as new ways of connecting and sharing with Stories. More professionals are turning to LinkedIn Learning to increase their knowledge capital, watching more than a million hours of content each week, more than double the amount a year ago. Three people are hired every minute on LinkedIn, and new features make it easier for nearly 40 million job seekers to indicate they’re looking for their next opportunity. In marketing solutions, advertiser demand on LinkedIn returned to near pre-COVID levels, up 40 percent year over year, as marketers use our tools to connect with professionals ready to do business. And organizations continue to tap into the combination of LinkedIn Sales Navigator and Dynamics 365 to ensure salespeople have the context they need to sell remotely. Now to Microsoft 365. PCs have become mission critical to sustain work, learning, and life at home and maintain business continuity in the enterprise in a remote everything world. Windows 10 monthly active devices are up double digits year-over-year, across commercial, consumer, and education. And, we will have the largest lineup of Surface and OEM devices ever this holiday season to support every person and work style. Microsoft 365 is the comprehensive suite of productivity apps and experiences people use and rely on every day. Teams now has more than 115 million daily active users. We are seeing increased usage intensity as people communicate, collaborate and co-author content across work, life, and learning. All up, Microsoft 365 users generated more than 30 billion collaboration minutes in a single day this quarter. Teams is the only solution with meetings, calls, chat, content collaboration, as well as business process workflows – in a secure, integrated user experience. And, as companies move online, they also want one unified platform from meetings to phone systems – which Teams delivers. The key to productivity is to move beyond transactional meetings and stay in the flow of work and maintain business process context. That’s where Microsoft 365 and Teams stand out. You collaborate on a PowerPoint presentation before a meeting and share it with participants in SharePoint. If you miss a meeting you can access a recording via Stream and catch up via persistent chat. Action items can automatically be assigned in Lists. With Power Platform in Teams, you can build custom productivity apps using lists as the data source. And you can even connect Dynamics 365 to Teams so you can see customer information and take action. It’s clear that people will need more flexibility in when, where, and how they work. We are adding reimagined workspaces in Teams for every collaborator – remote, in-person, or on the go – and we are accelerating our innovation for both firstline and knowledge workers – with over one hundred new capabilities in the last six months, including breakout rooms, meeting recaps, shift scheduling, and large scale digital events with up to 20,000 participants – to help people transcend both time and distance. Employee health and wellbeing is a top concern for every CEO. We are innovating with new experiences to help people prioritize wellbeing in the flow of work. New insights in Teams provide personalized recommended actions, making it easier for employees to create healthy work habits and for leaders to build high-performing teams. New virtual commute gives structure to the remote workday with scheduled cognitive breathers. And, Together Mode is helping employees at companies like Office Depot reduce video fatigue. More broadly, we are accelerating our innovation across Microsoft 365. New Microsoft Stream is the video platform for the enterprise – making it easy to create, share, and discover videos at work. Transcription and voice commands in Word help people save time. And SharePoint Syntex makes it easier to find and work with content across the enterprise. We are seeing Microsoft 365 momentum in every industry. In education, nearly 270,000 institutions are using Teams to power remote learning and improve learning outcomes, including the University of Nottingham in the U.K., Morehouse College, the University of South Florida, and some of the largest school districts in the U.S., like Miami Dade County Public Schools. In sports, the NBA and NFL are reimagining the gameday experience for fans. PepsiCo will deploy Microsoft 365 and Teams to its 270,000 employees worldwide. And, Morgan Stanley, PricewaterhouseCoopers, and Prudential Financial Insurance all chose Microsoft 365 E5 this quarter for differentiated security, compliance, voice, and analytics. Now to security. We are the only company that offers end-to-end capabilities to protect and manage data, devices, identities, and infrastructure holistically, enabling a cross-platform and multi-cloud Zero Trust architecture. H&R Block, for example, used our tools to implement Zero Trust principles in just two weeks, enabling thousands of tax professionals to securely work from home. In identity, Azure AD has nearly 400 million monthly active users – and we’ve seen usage of third party apps increase 2X since last year. In security, new Microsoft Defender simplifies threat detection and response – and now includes coverage for Android and iOS, as well as multi-cloud and on-premises protection for SQL workloads. In device and data management, Microsoft Endpoint Manager monitors an organization’s devices in a unified platform, and new tools offer proactive remediation of issues before they disrupt end users. And, in compliance, our new Compliance Manager offers more than 150 out of the box assessments for regulations such as GDPR. Now to gaming. Gaming is the most expansive category in the entertainment industry. Three billion consumers look to gaming for entertainment, community, and achievement, and our ambition is to empower each of them, wherever they play. Our Xbox Game Pass service has more than 15 million subscribers. Quality differentiated content is the flywheel behind the service’s growth, and the addition of EA Play next month, along with our pending acquisition of ZeniMax Media, will add more of the world’s most iconic franchises to the more than 100 high-quality games already available and materially increases our ability to increase content. We’re also transforming how games are distributed and played, and reaching new players on mobile and tablet, by bringing cloud gaming to Game Pass. Finally, we’re delighted by early reviews and excitement in the Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X, which will be the most affordable and most powerful consoles available. In closing, in a world of uncertainty and constraints, every person and every organization needs more digital technology to recover and reimagine what comes next. This represents an unprecedented expansion of our addressable market in every layer of the tech stack. We are focused on innovating and differentiating to meet these needs and growing opportunity. With that, I’ll hand it over to Amy who will cover our financial results in detail and share our outlook. I look forward to rejoining for your questions. AMY HOOD: Thank you, Satya, and good afternoon everyone. This quarter, revenue was $37.2 billion, up 12 percent year-over-year. Gross margin dollars increased 15 percent. Operating income increased 25 percent. And earnings per share was 1.82, increasing 32 percent and 30 percent in constant currency. Consistent execution by our sales teams and partners drove a strong start to the fiscal year. In our commercial business, customers accelerated their digital transformation priorities. And we again saw strong demand for our differentiated, high-value hybrid and cloud offerings resulting in increased commitment to our platform and higher usage. Overall, our transactional licensing business remained a headwind, although the small and medium business customer segment improved slightly through the quarter. In our consumer business, continued demand for PCs and productivity tools benefited Windows OEM non-Pro, Office consumer, and Surface. An improved advertising market benefited search and LinkedIn. And we saw continued strong engagement across our Gaming platform. Moving to our overall results. On a strong prior year comparable and relatively small expiration base, commercial bookings growth was ahead of expectations, increasing 23 percent and 18 percent in constant currency, driven by our core annuity sales motions and an increase in the number of large, long-term Azure contracts. As a result, commercial remaining performance obligation increased 24 percent and 23 percent in constant currency to $107 billion, with a roughly equivalent split between the revenue that will be recognized within the next 12 months and beyond the next 12 months. Commercial cloud revenue grew 31 percent to $15.2 billion. And commercial cloud gross margin percentage expanded 5 points year-over-year to 71 percent, driven by the change in accounting estimate for the useful life of server and network equipment assets discussed in our July earnings call. Excluding this impact, commercial cloud gross margin percentage was up slightly, despite revenue mix shift to Azure and increased usage to support our customers’ remote work scenarios. This quarter, FX had no impact on revenue growth, more favorable than anticipated, due to the weaker US dollar. And in line with expectations, FX had no impact on COGS or operating expense growth. Company gross margin percentage was up 2 points year-over-year to 70 percent, driven by the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, company gross margin percentage was down slightly, with increasing cloud revenue mix and continued investments, such as trial offers and flexible financing options, that delivered greater customer value in this challenging environment. Operating expense increased 3 percent, lower than anticipated, driven by greater than expected COVID-related savings and investments that shifted to future quarters. And operating margins expanded 4 points year-over-year to 43 percent, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to our segment results. Revenue from Productivity and Business Processes was $12.3 billion, increasing 11 percent, ahead of expectations, primarily driven by LinkedIn and Office consumer. On a strong prior year comparable, Office commercial revenue grew 9 percent with continued impact from the transactional weakness noted earlier. Office 365 commercial revenue grew 21 percent and 20 percent in constant currency, driven by installed base expansion across all workloads and customer segments as well as higher ARPU. E5 revenue growth accelerated with strong value in our advanced security, compliance, and voice components. Paid Office 365 commercial seats increased 15 percent year-over-year, with early momentum in free trial conversions. And we saw continued seat growth in small and medium business and first-line worker offerings, with improvement through the quarter, though again at more moderated levels. Office 365 commercial now accounts for over 70 percent of our existing Office Commercial paid installed base. Office consumer revenue grew 13 percent, with better than expected sales of Office 2019 and accelerating growth in Microsoft 365 subscriptions, up 27 percent year-over-year to 45.3 million. Dynamics revenue grew 19 percent and 18 percent in constant currency, better than expected, driven by Dynamics 365 revenue growth of 38 percent and 37 percent in constant currency. Growth in the number of customers adopting multiple Dynamics 365 workloads accelerated, reflecting the value of our modern solutions with compelling time to value. LinkedIn revenue increased 16 percent, significantly ahead of expectations, primarily driven by a stronger advertising market that benefited our marketing solutions business. Segment gross margin dollars increased 13 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year, including roughly 2 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate, partially offset by sales mix to cloud. Operating expense increased 4 percent, and operating income increased 19 percent year-over-year, including 6 points due to the change in accounting estimate. Next, the Intelligent Cloud segment. Revenue was $13 billion, increasing 20 percent and 19 percent in constant currency, slightly ahead of expectations. On a significant base, server products and cloud services revenue increased 22 percent and 21 percent in constant currency. Azure revenue grew 48 percent and 47 percent in constant currency, driven by consistent, strong growth in our consumption-based business. This quarter, we saw better than expected growth in our per-user enterprise mobility business as the installed base increased 27 percent to 152 million seats. And our on-premises server business decreased 1 percent, with impact from continued transactional weakness and a strong prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows Server and SQL server 2008. Enterprise Services revenue grew 6 percent and 5 percent in constant currency, again driven by Premier Support Services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 26 percent and 25 percent in constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased 3 points year-over-year, with nearly 4 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Operating expense increased 10 percent, and operating income increased 39 percent and 38 percent in constant currency, with roughly 13 points of favorable impact from the change in accounting estimate. Now to More Personal Computing. Revenue was $11.8 billion, increasing 6 percent, with better than expected performance in Windows OEM non-Pro, Surface, and Search. In Windows, overall OEM revenue declined 5 percent, better than expected. OEM non-Pro revenue grew 31 percent, benefiting from demand for larger screens for productivity. And OEM Pro revenue declined 22 percent, impacted by lower commercial demand across all customer segments and a prior year comparable that benefited from the end of support for Windows 7. Inventory levels ended the quarter in the normal range. Windows Commercial products and cloud services revenue grew 13 percent and 12 percent in constant currency, slightly below expectations, as continued demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security solutions was partially offset by a lower mix of multi-year agreements that carry higher in-quarter revenue recognition, as well as continued transactional weakness. In Surface, revenue grew 37 percent and 36 percent in constant currency, driven by year-over-year differences in product launch timing and channel purchasing as well as overall PC market demand. Search revenue ex TAC declined 10 percent and 11 percent in constant currency. And in Gaming, revenue increased 22 percent and 21 percent in constant currency, driven by continued strong engagement and monetization across the platform, though at a slightly lower rate than last quarter. Xbox content and services revenue increased 30 percent, with strong growth in third party transactions, GamePass subscribers, and first-party titles. Segment gross margin dollars increased 8 percent, and gross margin percentage increased 1 point year-over-year as improvements primarily within Gaming and Surface were mostly offset by a lower mix of Windows revenue. Operating expense decreased 8 percent, and operating income grew 18 percent year-over-year. Now back to total company results. Capital expenditures including finance leases were $5.5 billion, up 15 percent year-over-year to support growing customer usage and demand for our cloud services. Cash paid for P,P, and E was $4.9 billion. On a low prior year comparable that included tax payments related to the transfer of intangible property, cash flow from operations was $19.3 billion, up 40 percent year-over-year, and free cash flow was $14.4 billion, up 38 percent. Excluding the impact of these tax payments, cash flow from operations grew 12 percent as healthy cloud billings and collections were partially offset by higher supplier payments related to the Xbox hardware inventory build. And free cash flow grew 3 percent, reflecting a significant increase in cash payments for P,P, and E. Other income and expense was $248 million, higher than anticipated, driven by net gains on foreign currency remeasurement and investments, including mark-to-market gains on our equity portfolio. Our effective tax rate was 14 percent, with a greater than expected impact from equity vests in the quarter. And finally, we returned $9.5 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends, an increase of 21 percent year-over-year. Now let’s move to our outlook. In our commercial business, expanding addressable markets, differentiated value, and consistent execution should drive another quarter of increased usage and growing commitment to our platform that drive commercial bookings. However, a declining expiry base will impact growth. As always, large, long-term Azure contracts are more unpredictable in their timing and an increasing mix of these long-term agreements drives more quarterly volatility in bookings. And though trends have improved a bit, growth will continue to be impacted by transactional weakness. A strong prior year comparable that included the end of support for Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, as well as transactional strength in Japan across our Office businesses, will also impact growth rates. In our consumer business, we expect some benefit from continued consumer PC market growth, though at a more moderated growth rate than last quarter given the traditionally high volume of PCs sold every Q2. Commercial cloud gross margin percentage will increase approximately 3 points year-over-year, again driven by the change in accounting estimate noted earlier. Excluding this impact, continued improvement in Azure IaaS and PaaS gross margin will be offset by mix shift to Azure. And on a dollar basis, we expect capital expenditures to be roughly in-line with last quarter to support growing usage and demand for our cloud services. Now to FX. Based on current rates, we expect FX to increase total company revenue and operating expense growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on COGS growth. Within the segments, FX should increase Productivity and Business Processes and Intelligent Cloud revenue growth by approximately 1 point and have no impact on More Personal Computing revenue growth. Next to segment guidance. In Productivity and Business Processes, we expect revenue between $12.75 and $13 billion. In Office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with continued upsell opportunity to E5. However, growth will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable noted earlier, as well as a decline of approximately 30 percent in our on-premises business, driven by continued transactional weakness and the ongoing customer shift to Office 365. In Office consumer, we expect revenue to grow in the mid-single digits, down sequentially, as continued growth in Microsoft 365 subscription revenue will be impacted by the strong prior year comparable and the seasonality of the PC market noted earlier. In LinkedIn, we expect the improved advertising market and continued strong engagement on the platform to drive revenue growth similar to last quarter. And in Dynamics, continued Dynamics 365 momentum will drive revenue growth, though at a slightly lower rate than last quarter in line with historical seasonality in that business. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue between $13.55 and $13.8 billion. In Azure, revenue growth will be driven by our consumption-based business, with continued strong growth on a significant base. And in our per-user business, we expect growth rates to moderate further given the size of the enterprise mobility installed base. In our on-premises server business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid and premium offerings will be offset by continued transactional weakness and the impact from the prior year comparable noted earlier. And in Enterprise Services, we expect revenue to be up low single digits. In More Personal Computing, we expect revenue between $13.2 and $13.6 billion. In Windows, on the strong prior year comparable, overall revenue should decline in the high single digit range. In our OEM business, we expect another strong quarter in OEM non-Pro, but OEM Pro will again be impacted by the lower commercial demand. In Windows commercial products and cloud services, we expect healthy annuity billings growth driven by the continued demand for our advanced security solutions. However, growth will be materially impacted by a lower mix of multi-year agreements that carry higher in-quarter revenue recognition primarily due to the declining expiry base and a large deal in the prior year. In Surface, revenue will be relatively unchanged, impacted by the year-over-year timing differences of product lifecycle transitions noted earlier. In Search ex-TAC, we expect revenue to decline in the mid to high-single digit range. And in Gaming, we expect revenue growth in the high 20 percent range. We expect very strong demand following the launch of our next generation Xbox Series X and S consoles driving supply-constrained hardware revenue growth of approximately 40 percent. We also expect a negative gross margin impact from console sales this quarter, as we invest against the growing life-time value of the platform. Xbox content and services revenue should grow in the low 20 percent range, with strong engagement and continued momentum in GamePass subscribers. As a reminder, our outlook does not include ZeniMax, which we still expect to close in the second half of the fiscal year. Now back to company guidance. We expect COGS of $13.75 to $13.95 billion and operating expense of $11.4 to $11.5 billion. In other income and expense, interest income and expense should offset each other. And finally, we expect our Q2 tax rate to be approximately 16 percent. In closing, I’d like to share a few thoughts as we look beyond the next quarter. As digital transformation accelerates and our sales teams and partners continue to execute well in serving customers, our high value solutions should drive full-year double-digit revenue growth in our commercial segments even in a challenging and competitive environment. Given our significant ambition, desire to enable our customer’s visions for their future, and the opportunity that creates, we will continue to invest in high growth markets and strategic areas that will further enhance our position. With that. Mike, let’s go to Q&A. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Amy. We’ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect to others on the call, we request that participants please only ask one question. Operator, can you please repeat your instructions? (Operator Direction.) KEITH WEISS, Morgan Stanley: Excellent. Thank you for taking the question, and very nice quarter. I wanted to talk a little bit about intelligent cloud and the trends that you’re seeing there. We’re picking up in stuff like our CIO survey a really strong indication from CIOs that they want to move more aggressively to the public cloud. We’re seeing that in good results from Azure. How should we think about the on-premise Server & Tools business on a going forward basis? Is this increased preference for public cloud going to more permanently impair server and tools growth in the on-premise environment or is there a potential for this to be coming back to the low to mid-single digit growth that we’ve seen historically once we pass these tough comps? SATYA NADELLA: Let me start, Keith. Thanks for the question, and Amy, you can add to it. A couple of things, Keith. One is, the approach we’ve always taken is that distributed computing will remain distributed, so the cloud and the edge is what will be the distributed fabric for applications. If you look at where our growth is coming from for the all-up number in Intelligent Cloud, it’s coming from the infrastructure layer, the flexibility that we have around hybrid deployment. Things like Azure Arc are very differentiated. Same thing with data. One of the big feature innovations even in the last quarter was the ability to deploy, for example, Azure data in any cloud, including the edge. That deployment drives application preference for our infrastructure. The two other things that are happening is developers, whether it’s lift-shift-modernize motion or just new applications, because of what they’re doing on GitHub or Azure DevOps, VS Code, choosing Azure services, and with Power Platform, Dynamics or M365, because a lot of these logic apps that people build are about stitching together extensions of workflows of multiple SaaS apps. We have all three of these trends leading to more intense usage of infrastructure data and the application PaaS services. That’s how we view it. I don’t sort of look at each quarter what’s happening on server plus cloud, I look at the holistic deployment options that our customers need for their increasingly distributed applications. That’s sort of what I see. Amy, if you want to add to it, please go ahead. AMY HOOD: Sure. And Keith, maybe I can help a little bit. In general, I think it’s easier if you think about Azure plus the annuity business as being this durable hybrid edge, cloud value that Satya is talking about, and we continue to see very strong and consistent performance across those things in terms of renewal rates, the strength of premium, the strength of hybrid value properties. That aspect, Keith, because of the reason Satya mentioned, we don’t see nearly as much change in that. It’s frankly why you see bookings numbers that are very good. It’s why you see RPO both less than 12 months. Think about that as our core annuity motion versus longer than 12 months, which are these Azure longer contracts, all having very healthy growth. Then what you’re left with is a small component of the business, which is that non-annuity/what we call transactional business, which is one-time purchases, all recognized in quarter. Because of that, it does move around a lot more and it helped, obviously, when we had and of support and we were transparent about that, and then it hurts more, both in this macro environment, but more so just because of some tough comparables. And so, while we will continue to have that through a few quarters, and we’ll expect it to bounce around a bit because of the nature of 100% in-quarter recognition, the fundamentals of bookings, renewals, premium and hybrid value, as well as Azure consumption, feel far more consistent than not is how I would answer that. KEITH WEISS: Excellent. That’s super helpful. Thank you, guys. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) HEATHER BELLINI, Goldman Sachs: Thank you so much for taking the question. Amy, I had a question. You just made some really strong, robust growth comments on the topline as you look out into the future, but you also invested, rightly so, your desire to invest for your customers in key growth areas. I think one of the questions people might be wondering is, how do we think about how that might impact operating margin trajectory, and should we interpret your comments that obviously growth remains really strong and we’re investing for growth, but there’s an eye on profitability as well? Like, how would you like those comments interpreted a little bit more deeply? Thank you so much. AMY HOOD: Thanks, Heather. If you take a step back, the comments were really about the consistency and the opportunity in front of us. In our commercial segments, where we’re seeing consistent annuity execution, we’re seeing increasing usage, we’re seeing good deployment, and frankly, the portfolio that Satya went through in his comments, if you go section by section, it’s talking about amazing, like, TCO advantages that the portfolio offers, even for our commercial customers who are looking for ways to accelerate, but control cost. And so, for us, when you see operating environments like that, where you see the opportunity, you feel good about your portfolio, and we basically feel good about our complete stack, but at a high value, what we want to make sure we do, and my comments were around this, are really about making it clear that we intend to continue to go after the opportunity we see. And so, of course, we’re always thoughtful about how we invest, but in these areas where we see such strong signal, I do expect us to continue to focus. And at the operating margins, a real focus will also just be as we enter the second half of the year. It’s obviously impacted by some of the hardware investments that we’re making, as well as the overall Windows numbers. That’s probably the best way to think about that. HEATHER BELLINI: Thank you so much. AMY HOOD: And Heather, congratulations. We’ll miss having you on the call after seven years. HEATHER BELLINI: Thank you so much, bye. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Heather. Operator, we’ll move to the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) MARK MOERDLER, Bernstein Research: Thank you very much for taking the question, and congratulations on a really nice, clean quarter. Given the flare ups in COVID in certain geographies and continuing lockdowns, do you think there’s increasing pressure on overall spending? Does it impact SaaS adoption going forward? And adding to that, how do you see your supply chain for the cloud components? Are you going to be able to meet all the demands? Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Maybe I’ll start, and Amy, you can add to it. Overall, what we have learned over, whatever, the last nine months or so is the best way for any business to ensure both resilience, as well as pivot and transform and reimagine how to work with some of the constraints, is digital tech. Whether it’s infrastructure, whether it’s data or on SaaS, it’s in fact increased adoption rate and that’s what you see. Like, where you see it in Power Apps, for example. In many cases, even the smallest of businesses need to be able to deploy a solution quickly for some workflow that allows them, say, for example, to do curbside pickup if you’re a retailer and a small business. But they were able to build that easily and deploy it. That’s what we’re seeing, which is increasing adoption and use. On the supply chain side, we have worked through. When we had the initial rush, we did have demand surges that needed us to sort of work through our supply chain and we feel we’re good right now on how the supply is working to support the demand. Amy? AMY HOOD: Nothing to add, Satya, thank you. MARK MOERDLER: Thank you very much, appreciate it, and congrats. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Mark. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) PHIL WINSLOW, Wells Fargo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on another great quarter. I just wanted to focus in on Office 365 commercial. And Amy, thank you for that update that you’re now 70% penetrated. If I go back to the Financial Analyst Briefing back in 2017, that was 50%. I guess two questions. One is that, could you help us sort of unpack just the install base growth? Obviously, with those two percentages and the numbers you gave, that’s pretty healthy install base growth. And then as a follow up-to that, and one of the things you mentioned, too, is obviously the continued migration to E5. Sort of what inning are we in for the sort of the E3 to E5 motion and how important is voice, which is one of the things you mentioned on that E5, just to Office 365 going forward? SATYA NADELLA: Amy, go ahead. AMY HOOD: Let me break down your question, Phil, because I want to make sure that the comment on 70% is really thought about in the right way. It’s 70% of the current installed base. And so, one of the key components of that is, we have, as you said, continued to see installed base growth. Whether that’s adding first-line worker scenarios, whether it’s increasing in small business, there’s so many ways for us to continue to add tremendous value, continue to grow the installed base. But we are pleased that we have 70% on more modern experiences, obviously, of Office 365 in terms of adding to productivity, and being able to continue to offer, to your point, some of this motion on E3 and E5. To that question, there’s actually room, Phil, on both of those motions. We’ve got room to continue to have people move to E3. We’ve got room to continue, obviously. And it’s not just voice, although that is an important component. The really exciting value in E5 is that it offers security value, it offers compliance value, it offers voice. There’s analytic value. And so, the reality is all of them are becoming more meaningful, especially in time to value and TCO. The one thing also that I sometimes think gets missed when we talk about Office 365 is one of the other key motions that’s important around this group in business is the ability for us to continue to add the Microsoft 365 components, whether that’s EMS or Windows security value. And so, while we’re excited about the installed base and the progress, it also creates a good opportunity for us to continue to move people to the Microsoft 365 SKU and not just up through this SKUs of Office. PHIL WINSLOW: Great, thank you very much, appreciate it. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Phil. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KARL KEIRSTEAD, UBS: Thank you. Amy, I wanted to ask you a question, given the comment you made about bookings volatility. I wanted to ask about some of the Azure trends in particular that we can’t see, such as the level of Azure migration activity that might still be in the planning phase or if deals have been signed, how you feel about the Azure backlog that will convert to revenues over the next year or so, and whether some of the Azure go-lives have been pushed by a quarter or two, given the uncertain environment. That kind of color might serve as a nice complement to the solid 47% reported Azure number you gave. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Go ahead, Amy. AMY HOOD: Karl, it’s a good question. Maybe let me break down some of some of the components. When you think about Azure and some of these longer term sort of deals I was discussing, the longer term, bigger deals, when I talk about them being more volatile, it’s more that we don’t really focus on the exact moment in time that they get done. They tend to be partnerships that we’re really working through. They take longer for planning. These types of partnerships, it’s really about making sure we make them successful, far more than which quarter that they arrive in. And so, that does just result in a little bit more volatility in that bookings number now. I would separate that from the question you’re asking, which I think is great, around how much of that creates a funnel of opportunity for us in terms of converting those plans, as well as maybe hybrid benefits that exist today in our good annuity performance on-prem. For us, that is about investing in customer success. And so, for us, that’s been one of the important investments we’ve made over the past couple of years and why we continue to invest in everything from skilling at our customers up through training, up through deployment, and really make sure that each project is successful and has good value. And so, when you think about that, think about the annuity on-prem business, as well as these longer term Azure contracts, as being effectively a book of business to continue to work and convert into, as you’re talking about, this consumption. Now, within a quarter, the consumption obviously has other impacts. Most of it obviously is it’s used and it’s recognized in quarter. You’ll see that number, as you know, jump around a little bit from quarter to quarter. Some of that is the per user that we’ve talked about. Things like EMS can have a little bit more in-quarter recognition. They can be impacted by an expiry base. You’ll see that number, the Azure KPI jump around a little bit more than just from consumption, and you can have things like overages land on an annual basis as opposed to maybe a monthly basis, and that can also make the numbers jump around a little bit. While the funnel and the conversion is absolutely how we think about seeing strong bookings and a strong, especially longer than 12 month RPO balance, we certainly also sort of work that meticulously at the customer level to get projects to success. SATYA NADELLA: Just one thing I would add is, to Amy’s earlier comment about our customer success motion, when we look at the app portfolio for any customer, we look to see, first of all, which apps do they want to just retire, which apps do they want to modernize and move to the cloud or new cloud starts, and then we use all of what is there on our stack to help them. It could be a Power App that gets built, which is more part of Office 365 or Microsoft 365. It could be a SaaS application that is in Dynamic’s module that’s better for them because that’s a faster time to value. And sometimes you build in Azure. We look at it holistically across all of the tech stack versus any one thing, because that’s what we think what differentiates Microsoft and creates preference for Microsoft long term. That’s how we approach it. KARL KEIRSTEAD: Okay, thank you both. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Karl. Operator, we’ll take our next question, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT THILL, Jefferies: Good afternoon, Satya, and good to see the Teams number double in the MAUs in a pretty short duration. Maybe if you can just walk us through your next chapter of the Teams story and where are you seeing the biggest opportunity and what other components you’re seeing attach to the Teams rollout. Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Sure, thank you so much for the question. Teams is very exciting to us, because unlike anything else that we have done at the application layer, it’s literally like a shell and has a platform effect, because it is meetings, it’s chat, it’s collaboration, as well as business process applications integrated into Teams. That scaffolding richness literally makes it very robust platform. We are seeing significant growth. We talked about the usage growth, but we are also seeing significant growth of usage across all these modalities inside of Teams. But the other aspect which I referenced in my remarks is, when you look at Microsoft 365 all up, Teams is bolstering all-up growth, right, because meetings are important, but there’s transactional. Work happens before meetings, during meetings and after meetings. That ability to have the workflow completely stitched together is where Microsoft 365 really stands out. That reinforcing the effect of Teams by itself and then Microsoft 365 in conjunction with Teams is where you’ll see a significant amount of usage growth, more so than individual tools of the past even. Maybe we go to the next question. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Brent. Operator, we’ll take the next question, please. (Operator Direction.) KEITH BACHMAN, BMO: Hi. Thank you very much. Satya and Amy, I wondered if you could speak to the growth of Windows within MPC. In particular, as we move past the tough compares, how would you characterize the growth potential of Windows and what would you envision are the key drivers and perhaps even the key risks associated with that, with those comments on what you envision a durable growth is on Windows? Thank you very much. SATYA NADELLA: So maybe I can start, Amy, and then you can add to it. If anything, again, the last nine months or so have proven that when it comes to Windows and PCs, they’ve become mission critical, because when it comes to remote learning, remote work and any type of activity and productivity in particular depends on having PCs and applications on PCs. We are doubling down on it. That means the innovation in Windows, and Microsoft 365 is the best way to conceptualize how we even think about Windows, because it’s one surface area where we want to deliver our best payloads for productivity, communications, collaboration, business process, and we’ll keep working even on the form function innovation as well. Even if you look at the holiday lineup of devices, it’s great to see that large screen, small screens, mobile, different chip architectures that make it pretty attractive to have a Windows device with you always. That’s how we look at it, as very important. I think, if anything, even mobile-only countries and mobile-only scenarios are recognizing that they also can do with some help with additional screens, and so that’s something that we look forward to. AMY HOOD: I do think one of the ways to think in particular about commercial demand for Windows, to Satya’s point, is while it can have and tends to have around end of support some raised demand on the front, then you have a year of tough comparables, as we say, then it tends to generally stabilize and be quite consistent. I think as we’ve seen in the past nine months, I think the high and mission-critical value of a PC in the commercial environment, whether you’re doing that from a remote situation or inside the walls of an office, I think we feel very good about the value that we’re offering. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Keith. Operator, we’ll take the last question now, please. (Operator Direction.) BRENT BRACELIN, Piper Sandler: Thank you. I’ll squeeze in two, if I could. I wanted to follow up on Azure. This is a segment that’s grown now to 17% of revenue. I think that’s up from 4% just three years ago. You talked about the number of petabyte scale applications doubling. From a size standpoint, it looks like in my model, Azure is bigger than the Windows business for the first time ever. My question really is around where we are at in the journey around Azure. How important is this to the Microsoft model, and ultimately, how big could it be looking out over the next three to five years? SATYA NADELLA: Let me start and Amy, you can add to it. The way I think about the computing landscape going forward is if you sort of said at the highest of levels today, as a percentage of GDP, tech spend is 5%. We think it will double in the next ten years, and if anything, this pandemic perhaps has accelerated that doubling. In that context, what’s the large, most secular need, it’s the need for distributed cloud infrastructure. It’s both needed for modernizing existing applications you have, and so that’s why, by the way, what, 20% penetrated? There’s 80% that needs to move. But more importantly, there’s going to be new applications starts which need infrastructure. And so if you sort of add those up, I think that we’re still in early innings. There will be between quarters volatility, all of the points that Amy made even earlier, but we think distributed cloud infrastructure is the most important layer, but the way we have approached it is not to just think of that layer in isolation, but the data layer work we do composes, the AI layer composes. And more importantly, our SaaS applications, whether business applications, Power Platform, Microsoft 365, all reinforce that same modern tech stack. I would still say that digitization with this new tech stack is in its very infancy. AMY HOOD: Brent, I think the last point Satya made is maybe the most important, is that when we think about and talk about expanding addressable markets or seeing more opportunity than we maybe even saw just a few quarters ago, it’s at every layer. When people say that they have constraints, when you need a better time to value, when you need to reinvent each and almost every business process in a fast and effective manner, having every layer of the stack enabled by the infra layer, the data layer and the AI layer, I do think it’s frankly early innings, even in places where people think it seems to be nearer the end. I think we feel a lot of optimism in that respect. BRENT BRACELIN: It certainly feels like an important milestone with Azure being larger than Windows for the first time. I guess the last question for me is really on AI. I know everyone has talked about this acceleration in digital adoption across consumer and enterprise, but it almost feels like the acceleration in AI is actually happening faster. I’d be curious to hear kind of the plans for GPT3 license and how you plan to democratize that across the platform. Thanks. SATYA NADELLA: Yeah, it’s a great observation because there are two sort of things that we’re seeing is, AI is actually being used by both professional developers, people who want these large scale transformer models or to even do zero shot learning. We are seeing significant increases in cog services usage across the board, which, by the way, comes with the use of other compute services and data services in Azure. But the other interesting thing is what I would call the domain experts who are using Power Apps, being able to tap into these cog services to build these workflow assisted with AI. That’s where a lot of productivity gains for a lot of businesses and business processes workflows is happening. It’s exciting to see that, as well as AI that’s incorporate. I mean, every Teams session is full of AI because of the transcription services, the speech recognition services and so on, that it incorporates, and same thing with Dynamics as well. MICHAEL SPENCER: Thanks, Brent. That wraps up the Q&A portion of today’s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today and we look forward to speaking with all of you soon. AMY HOOD: Thank you. SATYA NADELLA: Thank you all. Thanks so much. (Operator Direction.) END "
